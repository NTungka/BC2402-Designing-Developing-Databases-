# Project Submission Summary
The assigned project can be split into two key categories:
1. Firstly, query development for MongoDB & mySQL to obtain unique insights from a synthethic database of reviews, open comments & flight statistics for common airlines (e.g SIA, Emirates, Qatar).
2. Develop a theoretical chatbot capable of determining customer sentiment & take note of essential data ðŸ¤–

## Query Development 
We will focus on the unique insights from the airline-comparison portion of query development. Overall our team took a few unique approaches:

- All metrics associated with customer preference such as "wants_extra_baggage" were normalized agains the total flight time
- June-September were designated as "seasonal" timings with other months designated as non-seasonal
- Feedback & complaints from customers were sorted according to keywords. A summarised example is listed below

| Complaint Category | Sorting keywords|
|----------|----------|
| Seat Comfort  | "Legroom", "Seat", "Space", "Comfort"  | 
| Food & Beverages    | "Beverage", "Food", "Snacks","Lunch","Dinner","Breakfast"  | 
|Staff Service| "Care", "Polite", "Professional", "Friendly", etc.|
