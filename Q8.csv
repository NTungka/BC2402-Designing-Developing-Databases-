Airline, Reviews
Qatar Airways, "I had an upgrade offer for two persons for Business Class for booth flight sections in my app. After paying I got the message that it was not possible. I thought it was a bug, so I updated my APP content and got the upgrade offer again. I paid again and received the information a second time that it was not possible, after booking on my credit card. These amounts were blocked not just once, but twice each. 8,272 EUR from Qatar Airways were blocked on my card for a whole day. At the business check-in counter, no one could understand what had happened. Only reaction was please write a mail to Qatar Airways.  I have never experienced such bad service. In the flight from Doha the climate was not working. After more than an hour of waiting in unbearable temperatures on the plane, a glass of water was served without a word of apology why it was so hot on the plane. After about 3 hours the temperatures become somewhat bearable. Writing an E-Mail on August 4th to Qatar was more then useless. Qatar Airway told me it was a due a system error. Nothing about the very bad untrained Service on the ground and in the Air. As a Frequent Flyer you get a welcome on board but no Service to solve Problems.    Most disappointing flight Ive had for several years. Baggage damaged and Qatar refuted saying I left it too late and already went through customs. In fact I had gone straight from the carousel to the baggage claim. Both my meals were inedible. Power supply for laptop was old and plug kept falling out. We booked a month early and checked in early but got horrible centre seats. The problem was the online check in wouldnt let me change them. I had to phone and was told I had to pay $100 to change the seat. At checkin I tried again but first leg was Finnair and they couldnt change the seat. Then we tried when we got to Doha, before security and there was a long queue of other people also trying the same - we were 30 minutes in the queue and they said they couldnt change but someone else said to try at customer service. There was another long queue and this time they said there were no spare seats available any more. Was promised an hour of Wi-Fi as a prestige member but every time I tried it said satellite not available.   Maputo to Denpasar via Doha was very disappointing.  Qatar Airways was very average, and on occasions below average, on these flights. Chairs were not great, especially the entertainment console under the chair in front of you.  The internet was the worst Ive experienced, and the most expensive. Food was okay, nothing exceptional. Unfortunately no Qatar any more for me and its confirmed that the 787 is not my plane. The A350 is so much quieter and more comfortable  My family and I flew this airline and this Boeing 787 from Rome - Denpasar was complete hell. This is a small aircraft for that distance travelled (10.5 hours) seating is 3x3x3 and aisles are small. There is no chance of movement once boarded as there is a lot of time taken up by trollies in the aisle.   On this trip, my outbound flight from Manchester was delayed by a passenger becoming ill. Whilst I sympathise with a passenger, falling ill, of course, a speedier decision wouldve saved me from missing connections, which we inevitably did. We sat on the plane for an hour and 45 minutes, whilst it seemed the captain dithered over whether or not to offload the passenger. He did not offload them. Upon arrival in Doha, 15 minutes after my connection had already departed, I was handed a new ticket for a flight which left at 02:25, 7.5 hours later with no apology for the inconvenience caused. There was a flight leaving for Jakarta at 8 pm via Singapore, but I was not offered that option. There was another flight leaving at 08:25 the next morning which would have suited me best, but I was not offered that choice either. I asked if I could go into a hotel for the night to rest properly before taking the 08:25 flight in the morning. They advised me that because my delay was less than eight hours (it was 7.5 hours.) I was not entitled to a hotel. The business lounge in Qatar is not designed for lengthy waits so I asked if I might enter the first-class lounge at least for the duration of my wait given that the delay was the fault of the airline. I was refused because I am not a member When eventually we finally left Doha on that 02:25 flight, I was exhausted and my seat was next to the galley where I heard the crew banging, talking and generally being noisy. I have never experienced such a disengaged crew as this one. The media on the video system did not correspond with the series being advertised i.e., the new series of White Lotus that I was looking forward to watching, whilst being labelled as the latest one set in Sicily, in fact, was the original series which is  a few years old.   -I was informed three month ago that all 3 sectors of my itinerary were downgraded to the old seating. I was able to change my flights back to Qsuites by changing flights, but had to accept a 12h layover at Doha airport. Since I can sleep on overnight flights in the Qsuite only, I accepted the offer. Unfortunately both flights were downgraded again, I was informed about the Bangkok to Doha sector 3 days ago, and about the Doha to Zurich sector just 6h before the departure of the flight.  I was up to now willing to pay more, since Qsuites are in high demand and rates were this time around Æ’?Âª350 higher than other configuration. When I requested compensation for the previous flights, since I paid a premium for those Qsuite bookings too, I received 2 identical pre-written standard responses saying that they were not willing to compensate, not even with some Qmiles. I am really upset, since the Qsuites are promoted everywhere on the booking app, but whatÆ’??s the point of booking a Qsuite if I don get it! One of the mentioned flights was my 100th on Qatar, about 70% in Business class, but it never happened that there was a aircraft change from an old configuration to Qsuite, only the other way round. On a lighter note, the flights were outstanding, esp. the Bangkok to Doha sector (QR839) with great food and service. I want to thank especially the wonderful and hard working Purser and her team. I canÆ’??t really recommend Qatar at this point, since the hardware problems are getting from bad to worse.   Firstly, my flight from DUB to DOH was delayed for over 1.5 hours, causing me to miss my connecting flight to DXB. Upon arriving in DOH, I was informed that I would have to wait 5 hours for the next available flight. I sought reassurance that my luggage would be taken care of and transferred to the new flight. I was assured that it would be, but to my dismay, the new connection flight was also delayed by an hour, extending my layover to a 6 hours. I spent an additional 2 hours waiting in a queue to inquire about the whereabouts of my luggage, to discover that it had never left DOH. I was told it would be delivered to my accommodation by morning, yet to this day, it has not arrived, leaving me without essential items. The level of service has left me utterly disgusted.   We have been using Qatar Airways for over 10 years now without any issues. This time when we booked in their website we found Qatar using another airline called Indigo (cheap no-frill airline) for the Doha-Kochi route. We were absolutely shocked to see the service provided by both Qatar & Indigo. Quality of food has gone down in Qatar, no new entertainment / movies & Indigo Airlines was a disaster (no water provided, no screens for entertainment, rude staff etc).    First time flying Qatar Airways and definitely the last time. Seats were great and staff was also great and that is the only positive thing about the flight. But the IFE system did not work on my flight. The Ground staff was bad in New York, but ok in Doha. Flight was delayed 30 mins because of technical issues without further information.    Staff were unfriendly, did not smile and made me feel unwelcome. During service it looked unorganised and on our second flight it took 2.5hrs before a drink or meal was offered. Received a meal and saying thank you to the hostess who did not even acknowledge it. D0 not understand how they say the tomato juice is finished 2hrs into the 9hrs flight and they need to go see if business class has.  On our last flight they loaded us into a bus for departure in Doha. We had to stand in it for 30min at the gate before it moved anywhere and to top it off we had to board a hot plane sitting for 30min before taxing and any form of cold air.    The check-in was smooth and the crew was pleasant and the food was good. The seat was uncomfortable despite paying for a premium seat on the Doha-Chicago leg. The audio box intruding into the leg space makes a long flight very uncomfortable. The aircraft was clean but was not new. The choice of entertainment was not good especially the Bollywood section which was completely outdated. Qatar Airways crew did not seem to make any rounds with just water or juice. The inflight USB charger did not work on the Mumbai to Doha leg. The crew did not offer any alcoholic drinks without specifically asking for the same.   Even after I made it to the original flight at final boarding time by running through the airport (due to Qatar Airways late flight), the staff had bounced everyone to the next flight. I asked whether they could accommodate me since I had still arrived by final boarding time but they still said I had to wait for the next flight. Later when I went to the next counter was I told the delay was a day, so I was stuck at the airport this whole time and they could not even accommodate me in one of their lounges. If I knew the delay would have been so long, I would have argued with the staff more at the check-in gate instead of being polite. After I filed a polite and formal complaint regarding what the airline could do for me, I got a nonsensical response and they could do nothing for me.  Initial flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha delayed by 90 minutes causing a significant number of passengers to miss their connecting flights. These things happen which most people can understand - unfortunately, there were no updates given until passengers became so irate that they demanded the pilot make an announcement to update us (this happened three times). First announcement: apologies due to technical issues currently being worked on by ground staff. Second announcement: apologies, technical issues now resolved - just carrying out paperwork for clearance. Third announcement: apologies due to technical issues - almost resolved now.  Upon landing in Doha, met by a member of ground staff holding a sign, upon asking if the Manchester flight had departed she said yes. Next flight was in 6 hours - the compensation provided was the equivalent of 10GBP - to spend over the 6 hour wait (a coffee alone was 5GBP). Didnt give access to a lounge. Again, customer service upon receiving the compensation and my next boarding pass was poor - no smile, no apology for the inconvenience. I asked out of curiosity why my bag needed to go through a security check when Id just come from the plane - the response was that the previous airport flying from could have missed something. When flying flying back from Manchester on the return flight via Doha I didnt pass through any security checks to my connecting flight. One plus point to the flights - food is great, hats off to the chef. My TV on the return flight from Manchester to Doha was also not working.    Flight was okay and Doha airport and city both are very nice, amazing place. Problem is customer service on the phone. They dont speak or understand English very well. When you ask for supervisor because youve called several times and theyre not understanding, they give you a hard time and say the supervisor cant do anything and try to get you to not transfer. After insisting they put you on hold for 15+ minutes only for the supervisor to get on the line for a few minutes, and every time I called they hang up mid way through the call. They said an investigation would take 24-48 hours, it took 1 week.  Our flight was delayed 2.5 hours due to a technical difficulty and we were made to wait for the transfer buses for half of that. We were given a 45 QAR voucher which wasnt enough for a water and slice of pizza so we had to pay for the difference. On top of that the hostesses were constantly hounding us over having our feet in our shoes (which is a bad idea since feet start to smell inside shoes and disturbs other passengers). All in all I got the experience I would get in a budget local airline and Id rather pay more using a different airline than to experience this again.   The seat was small. The staff was very nice. There was a family of adults in front of us. As the plane took off, the man put his seat in full recline position and did not move during the flight. I had to put my legs under the seat next to him thus preventing my daughter and my wife from sleeping. I tried to tell him several times no answers. When i realised the family father was next on the right i showed him politely. He looked down on me in a very protective way. The staff did nothing on this flight but on the second part of the flight on the second plane another guy got reminded to put his seat in standing position whereas he just moved down the seat a little bit for few minutes. Good point: the food is nice and the videos too.   Great seats in business class qsuite and very well mannered crew. I would say that onboard services and staff are as good as it gets and ground service and staff are the complete opposite. Baggage was destroyed on my outbound flight and customer service has been useless in dealing with the issue and made no effort to resolve the issue before my inbound flight. The baggage allowance for business class is 40 kilos. The fee for extra baggage ranges from 10?Å“/kilo up to 18?Å“/kilos depending on the time you purchase it. They forgot one of my special diet meals on of my flights, providing me with  the breakfast on an overnight flight where 2 meals were offered (late dinner and breakfast). What made things worse was the Stewardess trying to convince me that because I ordered the special meal I only get breakfast! Then the supervisor came over to admit the mistake and apologise. Overall very disappointed with one of the alleged best airlines in the world. Service just does not match the level of product they are claiming to provide. Needless to say I wonÆ’??t be using them again.   Very frustrating experience with the airline. Paid during ticketing when booking my flight for extra legroom. However that did not get applied even though I have credit card receipt. I was Unable to select a different seat online via their app even though flight was not full. At airport was promised switch to exit row aisle. When I got to gate they put me in exit row center. I am 6Æ’??3 and for a 13 hour flight they could have been more accommodating. Poor customer experience. Inbound leg from Chicago to Doha did not have these problems.   Plane was uncomfortable, and my food was inedible. Upon flying home we had to pay over 900 euros in excess baggage. We were not given the opportunity to swap our luggage to carryon as were were told the plane was leaving. We had approximately staff pressuring us to pay and when I asked to take out a backpack which weighed over 8 kgs they would not reduce the price.  Once we paid their manner changed and we were escorted to our terminal only to find we had 40 minutes left to board. We will never fly Qatar again.   It was the worst trip I made overseas! Booked ticket on Qatar website and on return the luggage from DEL didnt arrive at Doha. The rude staff did not allow me to board flight to DFW! After debating with them that the booking was done by Qatar Airways and any connecting flight was their responsibility, I was finally made to stay overnight. Next day reached DFW and again the flight to my destination was cancelled! They flew me to an airport 2.5 hr away and husband had to drive 5 hr to pick me up. No amount of phone support would help. Very rude staff at Doha making you feel as if it was my fault the luggage didnt arrive. They need better logistics with partner airlines. I trusted Middle East airlines over American but its a mistake. Time tested Delta and American are still dependable. A 25 hr journey took 45h.   I purchased two tickets to ensure I have comfort and room to spread out. Got through Atlanta fine, they gave me my ticket but there was an issue at the gate which was resolved. Arrived in Doha and everything went smoothly from there to KL. On the return flight I was delayed hours before they reprimanded me for purchasing two tickets, as that was against their regulations. My ticket and my trip were deleted from the app and had to be redone at the airport, with the trip never reappearing on my app nor the option to review them. Arriving in Doha, the ticket had to be redone a second time and I was forced to show them receipts for my purchases. Flights were enjoyable but I will never fly them again.   I got my tkt 11 months ago. Biz class from Doha to S?Å“o Paulo. Selected window seat 8k. A month ago I checked my reservation and all correct. Today checking in, they had changed me to aisle seat 8G without any communication with me. Only window seat left is 11L.   The aircraft was changed at the last minute to an ancient one, with a seating configuration of 2-2-2 instead of 1-2-1 Q-Suites. Offering that kind of configuration for the same price as a Q-Suite is just robbery. Anyway, the crew was great and always willing to help. On the catering side, despite the flight leaving at 2am Qatar should in my opinion have a couple of full meals available for passenger who do not want to sleep right away. The only options were soup or salad or cheese. Given the age of the aircraft, the air was very dry and I could barely sleep.  In the future, I will avoid their ancient 777 at any cost!   Qatar Airways is a good airline, not expensive, no big delays at the departure, good meals. The crew was nice, but not able to help me with the wi-fi on board. I paid around ten dollars for using the wi-fi on board and couldnt use it. It was impossible to connect, and no one could help me.   Width of the seats is unacceptable. I can recommend business class, I advise against a longer economy class flight due to the seats.  I found the meals to be poor, seat uncomfortable, and the selection of beverages less than advertised. My flight was late, and when we arrived in Doha there was no support from the ground crew. When I missed my flight due to them being late, no explanation, vouchers, or even acknowledgment of any kind.   The flight from BNE to DOH in November 2022 was very pleasant in QSuite and with an amazing staff and great food. I was very happy. The flight from DOH to ZRH on the other hand was on a very old plane and staff didnt seem motivated. My Virgin Australia flight from MEL to BNE got cancelled and Qatar did give me the choice to go without that leg or cancel the entire flight. I had to organise the rebooking myself and they kept sending me e-mails about cancelled flights which every time I had to investigate to find out that there were no cancellations. The Customer service of Qatar ignored my complaint and did not respond.   My daughter left her trumpet on the plane. We contacted Qatar Airways in December and they replied after three weeks in January saying that they had the instrument and would return it. Since then, despite the fact that we have sent many emails requesting information / updates ... we have heard nothing. In terms of customer service they have been terrible. The Qatar Airways flight flight was ok, nothing special.   I booked Gatwick to Cape Town via Doha return. I was told that the first sector was a code share from LGW to Doha and would be operated by British Airways I reluctantly accepted this. I got told that on the return journey the Doha to LHR this sector was also going to operated by BA. At this point I told Flight Centre I wanted to cancel all the flights and get a full refund. My travel agent then came back with an offer to change the flight back to a Qatar Airways flight from Doha and to Gatwick which I accepted. We flew on LGW to Doha which was as expected a very average Club experience on an old style BA plane. Doha airport was a nightmare, badly signposted, heaving with people,  Wi Fi was rubbish a very poor experience. Doha to Cape Town in the Q suite is a very nice way to fly. Better than BA first class in many ways. It lived up to expectations and was good news. The day before our return to the UK, received an email from Qatar saying another change of plane and no Q Suite. Could not delay flying back due to commitments. The seat was hard, lumpy and uncomfortable and did not properly go into flat bed position. The staff on board were hugely apologetic but there was nothing they could do. A pretty poor flight to Doha, where we then found the main business class lounge closed and everyone packed into another lounge. The flight to Gatwick not a Q Suite but it was a reasonably modern plane with good service. I wrote to Qatar Airways saying I had not received what I had booked and paid for and got a very polite letter back saying they were not prepared to give me any compensation whatsoever.    Our tickets from JFK to MLE were changed from Jan 31 to Feb 1, 2023. Luckily, I found out before the flight date. On the day of the flight, the flight was delayed for more than 3 hours, and we missed the connection from DOH to MLE. Qatar Airways said they are not responsible for the compensation. Extremely disappointing. We flew 4 times with the airline, the flights were all smooth.   I bought a round trip business class Lite ticket under the expectation that it would be Q-Suite. I selected my seats in Qatar Airways seat app, which showed the Q-Suite layout. At ATL  check-in I was told that there was an operational issue and the aircraft had changed with an old business class seat. This happened on my return from DOH to ATL leg. As for DOH to BLR and BLR to DOH, we did get a Q-Suite and it was as expected.    The first leg from DC to Doha was on the 777-200ER with 3-4-3 configuration in economy which is an awful set up.  My food was inedible but service as always was excellent. I flew Business Class on the Doha to Denpasar route on a Boeing 777-300ER. It was an excellent flight even if entertainment options were limited. Then they informed me they failed to load my baggage in Doha. It was a 10 hour layover and they couldnÆ’??t get my bag loaded?  They informed it arrived at Denpasar hours later and said they were waiting for the driver to deliver it. And then nothing, it is 8 hours later and no update or response. No luggage.   Take off was 2140 and my food was served approx 2330. Kids meals were awful, and my children wouldnÆ’??t touch it. The meal service finished approx 45 mins later, lights went off, only for the lights to come on 2 hours later to serve a pastry. So we are wide awake and another 2 hours to go in the flight. Finally landed in Doha exhausted. Thankfully the crew and service were more prompt on the next leg, but my food was awful. Kids were served egg wrap and as there were no meat choices when crew came to us I was served a veg dish which was awful. Doubtful I will choose to fly Qatar again.   The flight from Cochin to Doha is on codeshare partner Indigo which is a low cost airline. There was no online check in, no connecting boarding pass, no PTV, no warm food, just basic sandwiches, no alcohol. The flight is shown as operated by Indigo on the ticket but that may mean very little to a lot of travellers.   The planes from Athens to Doha and back were extremely old A330-300. Seat space is limited, if you take a window seat there is a metal box in front of you. No wifi, no USB, LCD screen has limited brightness / contrast. Entertainment full of 2nd class movies and series. Doha airport lounge access is extremely expensive and restricted, which offered only 2 different dishes. Impossible to find a proper place to relax, only good option was the shower available. I tried to add the cheaper lounge before my flight but was not allowed because you have to do that 48 hours before the flight. Toilets are quite limited, I had to wait in line for 10 min for a toilet booth. Boarding was organized chaos in all 4 flights, especially the last one from Doha to Athens, where we had to had to use buses. Wait in line for a bus to arrive and delayed departure because of that. Check in was OK in Athens, very slow in Bangkok, had to wait 40 min in line. Food and service was fine in all flights but nothing spectacular, for example no sparkling water. Wifi was advertised in the flight from Doha to Bangkok but it worked only from Bangkok to Doha. In all, a pretty average to poor experience.   First leg was great, great crew, food and beverage good, travelling with 4 kids all happy. Second leg doh-cpt dreadful, no kids meals, ife rubbish plane old and dirty even though it was only 4.5 years old. Extremely turbulent flight but no reassurance from crew or pilot for nervous passengers.    You have to watch a lot of advertising about Qatar during the flight. The seats were not comfortable, the flight attendants were friendly but overchallenged with the service. I had to wait more than half an hour to get a can of beer, they wouldnt give me enough water. My request for any snacks was friendly denied two times in a row. I cannot recommend this airline.   
I had a Qatar voucher. I made a booking for February 2023 but sustained an injury within hours, so I cancelled. Despite this cancellation being within the 24 hour free cancellation that they so proclaim on their booking site, they have deducted ?Å“350 from the refund. Nowhere in their terms and conditions did it say that they would do this.    TheyÆ’??re currently using elderly A330 on the Nairobi route and these arenÆ’??t very comfortable compared to the B787 or B777 they used to bring to Nairobi. Terrible seat pitch. Tiny, faded IFE screens and the dreaded metal box under the seats that takes up half your legroom. And not enough room for carry on luggage if the plane is full. My flight from Doha to Nairobi was packed to the rafters so they were randomly selecting passengers to give up their hand luggage so that it could be put in the hold so as not to overwhelm the overhead bins on board. I had my standard cabin-approved trolley bag which I was told needed to be checked in. I had to remove my electronics and valuables and stuff these in my laptop bag to carry on board. I was given a flimsy zip tie to secure my bag and off it went into the hold. On arrival in Nairobi, it was one of the last bags to make it to the luggage conveyor belt. The flight was a night flight, so I opted to get some sleep rather than wait for dinner. After managing to fall asleep, I was awoken twice to be asked if I wanted to have dinner, which I clearly did not. On the plus side, the flight was bang on time to the minute, only marred by the long wait for baggage on arrival. Nairobi is a busy route for QR (most of their flights are full) so I donÆ’??t know why they put such a mediocre airplane type on it.    I have flown them a few times and never been impressed and last week there was no choice of breakfast food served two hours into a six hour flight followed by a snack 90 minutes later. Small half cup of tea and one milk sachet. No drinks service separated. IFE nothing near competition and quite small seats. It took a long time for the crew to move with the food service. Warm to hot cabin conditions. Good value for money so that was a saving grace and check in and boarding well organised.   After being stranded in CDG Airport by Vietnam Airlines I was thankfully able to book a flight home to Sydney in economy to make a family wedding. The cost, 4.2k, I can understand its a high price to pay for a last minute flight that I booked a little over 12 hours in advance, but its insulting to have an empty seat on the flight next to me and several other empty seats on the flight.  I paid an extra 90 euros to get into the business class lounge for my 13 hour layover, no where when I selected this option, informed me that the ticket is for only 6 hours in the business lounge.  My seat on the A388 was horrible, I was in front of the bathroom. I couldnt eat on the plane. My seat didnt recline properly, and the seat in front reclined further than the other seats in its row.   Very frustrated that when you book business class with Qatar Airways directly on their website that they outsource to Air Canada and they put me in premium economy for the third leg of my returning trip. I was then denied access to the Maple Leaf lounge because the ticket stated premium economy. Paid nearly $10 grand including taxes for round trip business class. ItÆ’??s very disappointing to see Qatar ruins the experience with Air Canada who could care less about customer experience.   Absolutely horrendous experience. The plane experienced a technical fault and our 0135 flight was cancelled. No fault with Qatar Airways, I realise this wasnÆ’??t their fault. However the subsequent quality of service was abysmal. Total pandemonium at the gate where having spent 2 hours on the plane with zero communication, we then queued at the gate for 5 hours and it was an absolute frenzy. Some people got their tickets changed, others told to go away. Most were told to go to the hotel and just wait for an update. By the time we left it was 8.35 am. Again no communication, no idea where theyÆ’??re going and no one told us.    Seat 40K, window seat without a window, so off to a bad start. Cabin service was inconsistent and was twice ignored drinks service despite the rows ahead getting 2 drinks services. Crew not attentive; grumpy and rude. Booked as an overall British Airways ticket and QR didnt come close to expectations.   Very disappointed and unsatisfied with my experience. The plane was old and the amenities were outdated. The seats were ok but somewhat uncomfortable. My food was horrible, I was provided beef with mashed potatoes. The meat was very chewy, cold and the sauce was weird. The desert provided was nothing special. Breakfast was more of a lunch, had the choice of chicken or noodles, my noodles were cold and dry, the desert was a strawberry yogourt. The eye covers were really uncomfortable. The airline advertised free 1Hr onboard wifi but the wifi was not functional at all past the welcoming page.   The flight to Singapore was okay at best, seats are close to each other. Food was good. In the flight back from Singapore we entered the aircraft on time, then we were informed that there are technical problems so we should leave the plane again. Afterwards we had to sit at the airport gate for four hours (still counting), no information were given to us, no water. The Singapore ground staff was not professional at all, they promised information that never came.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Qatar Airways. Flight canceled (happens often, Economics reasons), very late notification. Then lounge in Doha got canceled without noticing me (even though it was open). And then with a 7 hour delay in Doha QA was unable to offer an alternative which I would have paid for. Because Im not a Silver Member? Disgusting. No Qatar for business trips if you want to meet deadlines. Bad.  The work of the land crew during the check-in and customer support service is a total disaster. Very unprofessional approach and communications, they create rules on the way, they mess with documents, and they mess with your payment and reservation (for business class!) and then they struggle to resolve it. In the end, it costs you time, it costs you money and what is more important it costs you your emotional comfort and health. What is even sadder they dont care about it at all. I submitted my complaint right after the unfortunate choice of using their services and never heard back from them (its been 5 months). Fait to admit the cabin service was decent but by the end, it just wasnt worth it. Please save your money and dignity, chose someone else, literally anyone would do better.   Staff could not board me on at Montreal due to an issue with my passport and it took forever to clear that. Boeing 777 was not in great shape and was quite old. Washrooms were not in order from the get go and my food was horrible and was not sufficient.  The infotainment system on this 777 was not great.  The only positive thing was the Customer Service, which was pretty good and also the Doha airport is really nice. I am heading back to Vancouver soon and lets see how that flight goes.   On 26 OCT flight Kuala Lumpur to Doha in codeshare and operated by Malaysia Airlines was delayed 1,5 hrs due to technical problems. Todays experience at Doha is the complete absence of professionalism. There should be people waiting for the passengers at the arrival gate, separating the ones with short or missed connection in groups divided by final destination and guiding them to the proper channel to rebook their flight. In todayÆ’??s experience people were left alone in desperate search of the (now closed) connection gate and they were finally reaching the transfer desk. Here I spent Hours waiting in line in front of the eyes of staff who were bouncing people from 1 operator to the other, never taking any action. The decisions on who to serve and attend were based on who is angrier and shouting the loudest. Some people have been rebooked on the next day flight when there was another one after only 6 hours. At their further inquiring why they couldnÆ’??t board on the earlier flight they have been answered with a sorry and invited to line up again to get a 3rd boarding pass printed.    The food they provide for a long haul flight is insufficient and the quality of my food was appalling. The scrambled egg was a solid chewy rock with no flavour. The second meal was a cold sausage roll stuffed with chicken which was not appetising. Wifi on outbound didnÆ’??t work at all. The super fast Wi-Fi which I paid for in the return did not work for more then half the journey. I paid ?Å“150 for exit row seats I got a worse seat than the non exit row. Nowhere to put your belongings, you have to hold the blanket and pillow on your lap for take off and landing. Seat 23a has the door blocking your legroom so you need to sit at an angle to get any leg room. Our outbound flight was an hour delayed and we werenÆ’??t communicated with much. There were very few toilets available and there was a queue which was in our exit row legroom.    Boarding in Doha was chaotic, the messages by the gate staff were unintelligible.  Business Class passengers were invited to board first but the bottle neck at the gate prevented this and no one of the gate staff took action to allow priority passengers to board first. There had been an  equipment change and the booked QSuite was not supplied. Instead we were seated in their old 2-2-2 configuration with dated an uncomfortable seats. I dont really understand why QR still have this outdated product in service. Cabin Crew was excellent but my food was not very good at all. The Chicken Burger was tasteless and the fries that came with it were soggy. WiFi was not available. I expect a lot more froma 5 star airline.  Mumbai to Budapest via Doha. Seeing Qatar Airways consistently wins awards I was eager to experience it after a 4 year absence. Unfortunately the experience fell short of my expectations. The in-flight entertainment was not available on the Doha to Budapest flight. The captain apologised for it and explained it was a technical problem. The vegetarian option was a frittata from Mumbai to Doha and it was OK (I award the meal 6 out of 10) but the white wine served was warm hence ruining it!! On the Doha to Budapest the food was very bland (4 out of 10). It was carrots and cauliflower in a milky sauce and what was surely a negligible amount of cheese of it was in fact present in the dish at all. It tasted exactly like boiled carrots and cauliflower. There were three trolleys in the back side of the plane hence going in and out if the lavatories was a challenge. Upon arrival at Doha Airport it took a full 20 minutes to open the plane doors. This is probably because we arrived in the morning but an airport that claims to be the worlds best airport should get its act together on this front. The business class passengers who were only 5 or 6 passengers disembarked first hence prolonging the wait for those in economy by another 5 to 6 minutes. Despite that the flight was full disembarkation was via one door only (the front door). The bus taking us to the terminal was EXTREMELY cold. It was only 16 Degrees Celsius in Doha on that morning and the air conditioners were on full blast reducing the temperature inside the bus to 8 or 9 degrees Celsius. Because the size of busses for economy and business passengers are the same there was a traffic jam and the relatively short journey from the plane to the terminals in the freezing bus took 10 - 12 minutes. It feels like Qatar Airways treats its economy passengers as numbers on the accounting sheets else one would expect someone at Qatar Airways to at least instruct the bus drivers to switch off these dreadful air conditioners when it is cold outside.   Qatar Airways have promised me a refund but have failed to make the refund. They refuse to answer emails and hang up when I phone them  After a 36 hour journey, I arrived at LAX to find that the flight showing confirmed on the Qatar app had no record of my booking. I spent 30 minutes on the phone with Qatar trying to get on the flight. Qatar told me Id have to stay in LA for 4 days. While we were talking, the flight closed. I ended up paying cash for a ticket home on United. I have another flight with them in 4 weeks. A similar nightmare is unfolding. Rebook for a lower class of service, give up my premium seat on a 38 hour flight or pay cash for my own ticket from Reno to LAX that I already paid Qatar for. Be prepared to be stranded. Make sure you have enough cash to buy an alternative ticket home!  Myself and my wife are Qatar Airways users for the past 10 years. The recent visit the cost was almost 3 times but it was not a big concern for us if not for the food that was served. The food was excellent a few years back but a disappointment this time. My salad was  not up to the mark at all.    I have done the web-check in well before the travel and seats were also booked. While transiting through Doha, last minute ground staff said my seats were given to someone else and given me the last seat. I am very disappointed with this service and never expected Qatar airways to break their promise by providing this service.   The online wi-fi and entertainment system is limited and old (many airlines offer a wifi service which includes free wifi, live TV, numerous movies and series allowing you to watch them on your own device instead of outdated seat screens). The choice of food is very limited and the menu revolves around south asian food. I believe the menu should be more diversified and neutral. passengers should not waste 10 mins of their time watching  advertisement after take-off and before each movie/series. The cabin was clean. The cabin crew was professional. The overall experience is not bad but far from the best in the World.   New York to Kilimanjaro via Doha. Qatar cancelled one of our legs and rebooked us on a similar American Airlines flight. We had previously purchased upgraded seats on the Qatar leg of the flight, and despite their cancellation, nobody at Qatar customer service has refunded us. Ive called multiple times and emailed customer service 3 weeks ago with no response.    I flew from Toronto to Montreal to catch the Qatar Airway flight to Doha. In Toronto I was told that the boarding pass will be given in Montreal. When we arrived in Montreal there was no one to receive us at the gate and we were stopped at the gate that goes to the international boarding. After much discussing with security they opened the door to let us in to the departure check in counters. Qatar Airways staff were not aware that passengers from Toronto were stranded, but they check us in quickly and we went for boarding. The flight to Doha service was terrible, the food was very poor and we were served the second meal 8hrs after our first meal, with no snack between. The next flight to Goa was the same type of service. On the return flight though from Goa to Montreal was much better. service was better.  Weve traveled from Johannesburg to Istanbul in April 2022 and again from Johannesburg to Bangkok in May 2022. In both occasions we purchased pre paid seats. We have a specific place where we sit on the plane. Both cases we purchase business class seats. When we checked-in, in Johannesburg OR Thambo we were informed that our purchased seats were no longer available. This happened on both our flights, for Istanbul and Bangkok. We informed Qatar Airways about our disappointment and find it unacceptable to pay for seats and dont get. They said that they would refund us for the seats that we did not receive. We informed them in May, when we were back in the country. It has been 6 months now and still havent received our refund. I tried several times calling Doha headquarters, but no one can help me. They keep saying I should contact Customer Support. Then I got a reply in 28 August 2022 and said that I should re-do the online account application, which I did the same day. I informed Customer Care that I did the application again, but since the I havent received anything from Qatar Customer Care Service. I called Qatar Headquarters again in Doha, but yet again they cant help me. Just said I should send an email to tell us at Qatar Airways. For a 5 Star Airline they have the worst Customer Service. They are fast to sell you their product but they have no after service. They trick you to pay for seats, but in the end you do not get it.   London to Melbourne via Doha, our flight was late leaving London and as a consequence missed our connecting flight. 2hr time layover, Qatar did not hold the flight for us. As a consequence we were stuck in Doha airport for 20 hours and then had a 15 hr economy flight. They made us wait 4-5 hours for a hotel. I will never fly with them again.   Flights to BRU-DOH-BKK all well, seats, check-ins. Travel back BKK-DOH-BRU was a terrible experience BKK-DOH an A330 which was overdue its age of retirement, impossible to make my seat screen to function, small leg space. The only good thing about this flight was the served sack served before landing. And the staff is always okay on Qatar flights. The transfer in Doha 2 times transfer by bus, very unpleasant. DOH-BRU on one of the terrible Boeing 787s too many people crammed in too small spaces, uncomfortable seats, and no leg space.   I flew on Qatar Airways on April 27th, 2022 from Seattle, USA to Doha, Qatar. After a 2 1/2 hour layover, I was to fly from Doha to my final destination of Amman. The flight from Seattle had a problem that prevented it from flying. We taxied back to the gate, and sat on the airplane for almost three hours while they fixed the problem. Finally arriving in Doha, nobody was at the gate to inform me where to go, or what to do.  I got in line for Qatar Airways customer service. Customer service didnt offer me a hotel, so I spent the night in the airport. I wasnt booked on the first flight out in the morning, but they rebooked me on a later flight. My hotel reservation was non refundable. I wrote Qatar customer service asking to be repaid for my costs. They didnt offer me any cash compensation.    Booked trip for honeymoon and purchased extra leg room exit seats. Our seats were switched to middle rows and not together. Qatar has no customer service, phone support says you have to talk to them at the airport, when you talk to them at the airport they say you have to talk to them at the gate, when you talk to them at the gate they say they cant help because you have to do it at the check in counter. Then they say they can only help you if you send an email complaint. I did that and 2 months later still no response. At this point just trying to get the money back from the ticket upgrades that they did not honor.    Todays flight they ran out of meal choice and my screen continuously glitched even after hostess reset it. They didnÆ’??t have immigration forms onboard, which caused bottle neck in the airport. Previous flights they ran out of drinks after first round and were flustered running out of food so compensated with chocolates and chip packets.   Delayed just under 3 hours taking off from Heathrow with no info. Missed my connecting flight with no support from Qatar Airways. I then get to my destination and no luggage, no response to my complaint, no reaction, no apology and zero sense of urgency. An utterly appalling experience.   Cancelled my original flight (12h) booked me on a flight that I could not take (due to connecting flight) and when requested a flight of equivalent duration was told was not possible. The flight I was given had a 22h duration. Flights with less time were only offering Business Class. When I went to the airport and complained the assistant agreed that an 8.5 h layover is a bit too much and indeed very easily booked me on the morning flight from Doha to Athens on economy saving 8.5h of waiting.    I am very disappointed about my baggage. My trip was from Toronto to Uganda on July 4 . When we got in Uganda four of our luggage didnt arrive with us. I had to come back to the airport which is far and inconvenient transportation several days. I got my 3 bags in 12 days which is the day before the wedding. One of my bag is still missing. Today as of August 22 2022 I am already back from my vacation however I still didnt get my last bag and I didnt get an answer for that. I tried to contact the airlines they just keep giving me different numbers and told me to contact them by WhatsApp, but its all helpless.    On my journey to Male from Doha I was bumped to a 1.30am flight. It was a 2 2 configuration on an old plane. A gentleman was next to me, he laid down went to sleep. I could only get to the toilet if I woke him. The entertainment was poor and my food was poor. On my return journey from Doha to Manchester I was put in seat 6F a Boeing 787-8. Seat 6F was just in front of economy with a curtain and next to the toilet. The rest of the business class were separated from me by a walk way. All the economy passengers streamed pass making comments. The steward couldnÆ’??t care less. The toilet was in constant use by business and economy. My food was poor again, mind you eating next to the toilet didnÆ’??t help. Sorry Qatar very disappointed.   One day before boarding I checked on their web site and it stated QR947 will have Qsuites which was not true actually it was one of the ex Cathay Pacific aircraft they bought to cover the shortage of equipment they are suffering from the A350 groundings. They did not have WiFI, the service was alright and donÆ’??t get me started with the catering it was inedible neither the appetizer nor the main course or the dreadful crumble dessert which has so much sugar to mask itÆ’??s shortcomings, the main course which was a prime rib was so over cooked and dry, the tapas was poor ingredients. The IFE was outdated that I had to revert to my iPad.   Booked biz class and paid for seat reservations. No problem on fist leg but on checking in online noticed reserved window seat changed for one on the middle on the 2nd leg from Doha, no choice offered due to plane type change. Went to check in 5 hours early as could not get through to them, got the last window seat. So applied for a refund of the 2900 baht as they had not given me another window seat when they could have or offered me a choice. First they said I would get the refund in 28 days, then after a few weeks said no as the seat I did get was similar to the one I paid to reserve. Dont waste money reserving seats as they can change it and you do not get what you paid for.    They cancelled my initial connecting flight to JFK from DOH and insulted me more than assisted me. The representatives were very dismissive and one man even told me it was foolish to have boarded the flight in Nairobi to DOH, despite being told there that this was the best course of action. I asked about my ticketing options and after a very long wait I was ticketed for a flight to Amman where I would catch my transfer to JFK. I just had to wait for 5 hours, which I did. I asked for a meal voucher and was given the minimum voucher. I was able to eat a burger at Burger King and that cashier, Apple, was the nicest person to me of this whole experience. I went to the gate and my flight to Amman was delayed, meaning that I would miss my connection to NY. I went to the gate representative and asked for assistance. A manager came to meet me and said he would help me get the flight to JFK. He said the flight was fully booked but I would be on it. I was then brought to the quiet room and assured that they would come for me once I was ticketed. I slept for 2 hours and went back to the desk asking for an update. They said the flight to JFK was delayed and they would need to find another alternative. I asked if I will be upgraded for my trouble, but this was not possible.   I had a horrible service due to poor handling of my delayed baggage delivery to my destination. The airline failed to deliver my baggage with delays of 5 days and counting. The staff were uncommunicative, and didnÆ’??t show any care in trying to track and expedite my baggage. I am disappointed and completely frustrated with Qatar Airways service.   Worst service and communication Ive ever had to deal with. Was 2 days of utter hell. Arrived at Warsaw 3 hours early for check in, to find the flight was delayed 3 hours. The app never had my flights on it and constantly had to keep adding it. Doha a flight was changed with no communication again and changed seats without communication and at check in it was an oh sorry you just have to sit there. On the website it shows in case of a delay there is a claim process which apparently their staff dont know about and are trying everything in their power not to process. Bottom line is that they are an extremely incompetent airline.   London to Doha was delayed at Heathrow. Finally boarded the flight and sat there for more than an hour before being told there were issues with the plane. Later deplaned and told another plane was being prepared. As we were trying to leave, we got told to go back to our seats and that they might have fixed the issue. More time has passed and we were finally told it was going to take off. By the time we had left Heathrow, it was delayed 5 hours. This meant I had missed my connecting flight to Sydney. On the plane, the entertainment system at my seat didnt work. The touch screen failed and I had to move to the adjacent seat that was empty and use that screen. Food was okay, inflight service was good. Upon landing in Doha had my boarding pass taken from me and given a new one. I was not given any sort of compensation to use a lounge, got told to speak with the transfer desk. The flight from Doha to Perth which I was being redirected to was delayed by 2+ hours. When I got to Perth, to my shock horror, I was put on Jetstar Airways instead of a partner plane like Qantas. The Jetstar plane was also delayed by 2hrs. I was supposed to arrive in Sydney at 6pm on a Friday, I arrived instead at 8am on Saturday. I was only offered statutory compensation after I have still yet to receive. I not received a refund on the upgraded seats I paid for but was not able to use because of the delays.    I pre-booked the 16A for the seat for A350-900 with Qatar. I arrived counter in Rome and I was Informed the seat is taken by someone else and thereÆ’??s no other seats available for the row of 16. The staff couldnÆ’??t solve my issues. I checked again with transit desk, none of them bother to look at my email but rather just telling me sorry but all the extra legged seats are all reserved Not to mentioned the supervisor kept saying reserved is reserved. ThatÆ’??s why I was trying to show the email to the staffs but they donÆ’??t care. I believe the confirmation email I received is valid to prove the seat is reserved for me. In this case, obviously itÆ’??s double-booked However, none of the we staff  managed to solve my issue.    I had flight from Istanbul to Goa, but one day before flight company changed time of flight and in the end plane also was late and I lost my next two flights. I was at first in this kind of situation, didnt know how to get next flights and whats is with luggage. In this chaos between offices and departments in airport I lost my baggage tags. There were two suitcases. Qatar provided next flight, but with delay 20 hours which I spent in airport without any complaining and compensation. During my awaiting time they found just one of my suitcases and told me to fill application about lost luggage in final destination for second one and promised that it will be delivered during 2-3 days Any worries from my side I get used to trust people especially company with so high renting. I filled application for lost luggage after my arriving to Goa, but they didnt provide PIR code. More then 2 weeks they found nothing.    I had a two-part flight from Paris to Doha and then Doha to Tehran. The flight from Paris had almost one and half hour delay for which we had no clear explanation. With this delay, I arrived at the boarding for the Doha-Tehran flight 10 minutes before departure time, but staff did not let us board and gave us a ticket for 7 hours later. So we have to wait more than 7 hours in Doha so we can take our second flight. No apology or compensation was offered (apart from a free meal) and the only thing we can do is to send emails to Qatar Airways and go through a probably long and tiring path to register our complaint.    I was chosen for an Involuntary Downgrade to Economy class from business class for Doha to Phuket flight on July 8 because J class was oversold. Today I received email that I will be reimbursed 125$.   I missed my luggage at my final destination, Istanbul (SAW) airport due to my luggage mistakenly behind on the arrival date, 20 June 2022. The airline didnt manage to deliver my luggage until my return date, on 24 June 2022 and didnt contact or inform to me any update until I follow up or push them again and again.  I was unable to get any reimbursement for my unexpected cost on buying extra clothing or expenses. My luggage was found at Istanbul (SAW) airport at the end due to their update but couldnt manage to send it back to my hand yet.    My flight to Istanbul via Doha was affected by the retiming of flight QR947 SIN-DOH from 2115 to 1035 on 2 June of almost 11 hours earlier departure timing from Singapore to Doha. The resulted in an extremely long layover of 17 hrs 45 mins instead of a planned and bearable 7 hrs 25 mins. It was during the course of downloading the QR App that we noted that the flight timing differs from the timing originally booked. We called Customer Service Hotline immediately to understand the situation and our options. However, we were only told to contact Qatar Airways Customer Care via portal/email. We lodged our concerns to seek alternative arrangements and or suitable recovery efforts at Doha Airport. To-date we have not heard from QR office despite 2 email reminders. Upon landing at Doha Airport, we approached Qatar Airways Transit Desk to listen to what recovery arrangements have been made for affected passengers. We requested for a Æ’??Flight disruption letterÆ’?? to facilitate any possible travel insurance claim. The Manager told us that no flight disruption letter will be issued from Doha as the flight disruption had taken place outbound from Singapore. However, this was inconsistent with what passengers were told when the same request was made at the QR check-in counter in Singapore ie. to be provided at DOHA. In relation to our request for accommodation / lounge access, the Manager explained that due to COVID reasons, no accommodation nor lounge access could be arranged for affected passengers. Giving the benefit of the doubt to Qatar Airways, the least one would expect is for the airline to mitigate the inconvenience caused through other measures. Instead, other than meal vouchers, none was forthcoming. We also note that some affected passengers were able to have lounge access or sleep pods at their own expense.   I booked a flight for October 2022 from Dubai to Chicago via Doha and Boston in Q-Suite. Qatar changed my flight several times and now I am flying Dubai-Doha-Montreal-Chicago, not in Q-Suite. The annoying part was, that my ticket requested me to pay for my seat assignment. Of course I expected Qatar airways that if they change my flight, they also change my seat to the new route/plane for the fee, which I had paid for the original itinerary. With every change Qatar made, I had to call customer service, explain my entire problem and have endless discussions about why I do not pay again for a new seat assignment, if Qatar is the one to change my flights. It was nerve wrecking, time consuming and straightforward unpleasant and annoying. As nice as their Qsuite may be, the changes are horrible. And even though I am already on my way to Platinum status, this was my last booking with them, as I am fed up with an unreliable company.    The fare was through the roof but we had no choice as no other airline serves the route except Etihad and their connection times are ridiculous. The flight was on an older A350 and the age was clearly showing, the cabin staff seemed stressed and the food was limited for choice. No QSuites just the old configuration the airline is stretched because of lack of equipment.    I found the seating on their B777-300ER to be extremely uncomfortable (17 inch wide seats crammed in a 3-4-3 configuration) with worn out seat cushioning and cramped leg space with the most unfriendly, inattentive, and careless cabin crew I have experienced. Another disappointment occurred when they tried to cancel my wifes business class ticket without notification. When I called, I was lied to and told that the flight had been cancelled due to operational issues, but when I asked them how come our coach tickets on the same flight were not cancelled, they could not explain. They cancelled and re-booked my wifes ticket in excess of 6 times requiring me to spend hours upon hours on the phone with their Customer Service Center in Doha. This went on and on for 5 days until I was finally able to rescue my wifes original itinerary for the alleged flight that had been cancelled (QR 726) but was now somehow reinstated.  And even when they tried to make amends and promised lounge club passes for my family upon arrival in Doha, upon arrival there were no club passes nor any entries in the PNR record locator.  To say that my experience was underwhelming is an understatement.   Flew Philadelphia to the Maldives with a layover in Doha roundtrip in business class. The flights meant to be with QSuites, but due to last minute equipment changes, 3 of those flights did not have QSuites. Still, the service, food and seats were enjoyable. I was pleased the final flight from DOH-PHL was equipped with Q Suites. Really nice product. However we boarded late, sat on the plane for over 2 hours prior to takeoff due to a cargo issue. My flight attendant was forgetful and failed to bring half my meal, the coffee or cheese plate I requested, pajamas. The flight attendant on my husbandÆ’??s side was great though. Our bags never made it out of Doha. The agent promised my bag would be delivered to my home the following day. However the bag never showed up. I sent a message through Twitter and was directed to contact the baggage dept via WhatsApp. Still no response 28 hours later. I went back to Twitter and was then directed to contact baggage dept through the live chat which is a joke. 27 hours later and still no response. Back to Twitter and was told these things take time.  So nobody will tell me where my luggage is, how to submit for reimbursement, canÆ’??t get a response from any of the relevant channels, canÆ’??t speak to a live person.    Our flight from Amsterdam (1-July) was 3 hours delayed due to staff shortages in Amsterdam  airport security. Upon arriving in Doha on the 2-July, we had to quickly transfer to our connecting Perth flight. We were assured that our baggage would make the flight . When we arrived in Perth, our baggage was not there. We made a claim with the baggage handling service (Menzies). They said they would email us the next day - this never happened. We made a similar claim with Qatar but their lack of response with dealing with our missing baggage has been terrible. After 3 days Qatar has not been able to locate our baggage or supply the last known location. The baggage department does not answer the phone, their email, or their WhatsApp chat function. We have no idea whether weÆ’??ll ever see our baggage again.   Our flight was delayed from Kuala Lumpur so we had to transit for more than 24 hours in Doha. The airline did not inform us we had to apply for visa and so we wasted almost two hours trying to apply online. They gave us a three star hotel to stay in and bus for airport transfers during our unwanted stay in Doha. Cabin service were ok. I was travelling with family (my husband, daughter and I), but only two of us was in business class due to limited seats availability. We couldnÆ’??t enter the Al Mourjan lounge as a family.    The flight itself was fine however dealing with our baggage which they lost has been absolutely terrible. When we arrived at our final destination our checked baggage (along with 25+ other passengers) was missing. After 3 days Qatar has not been able to locate our baggage or supply the last known location. The baggage department does not answer the phone, their email, or their WhatsApp chat function. When I got ahold of someone in the reservations department they told me these things take time.  We are extremely disappointed with the service from Qatar.   Staff were slow in response but friendly. The frustrating thing is that no one checked the hand luggage sizes. They were well over 7Kg and some customers had more bags then the one. The overhead lockers were very full. This meant I had to store my cabin bag (weight 5Kg) 8 rows away. Almost impossible to get to once we had landed and people were standing up. If you are going to police the weight of luggage, be consistent.   Very poor experience, delayed flight and missing baggage. I was told IÆ’??d be contacted but was not. I was given a number to call no one answered. Baggage is still missing for more than 72 hrs nobody has bothered to call and provide any form of reassurance.    My husband and I are flying back from Turkey tonight via Doha and Qatar Airways have seated us at totally different seats/sides of the aircraft. We checked in at Bodrum and had a connecting flight so we were issued with two tickets each. I did not check the seats when we got our tickets. The first short 4 hour flight was fine. We sat together and had a good flight. But once we boarded the long haul flight we were told to sit in different areas.    My flight was delayed from Malaga airport traveling to Doha, they put me on a different connecting flight from Doha to IKA with over 8 hours of layover. When I arrived to Doha, the customer service didnÆ’??t offer me anything for this inconvenience. This is while the layover was from 12am until 8am, the worse time to stay awake specially with a shock of not knowing and being prepared. I have to mention that the flight and flight attendants were amazing but the airport staff were rude, not helpful and made me and so many other wait at the counter with no response for 40 min at a time while refusing to respond to our concern. I had requested a gluten free meal that I didnÆ’??t receive!  IÆ’??m sorry that such a good aircraft has such a poor customer service.   Breakfast was not served until 10 am so asked for a cup of tea at about 9 am to be told, no because service starts in 10 mins. 1 hour later still waiting. However the worst part was the layover in Doha. We are Qantas Gold members and were not allowed in the Business Lounge, we got the runaround and were eventually directed to a below quality lounge with inadequate bathroom facilities.    I bought 2 return tickets on Kiwi.com from Brisbane to Warsaw via Doha. We were supposed to have 2.5h layover in Doha going from Australia to Poland and 1h on our way back.  We were very happy that we found such connection. One month later, on  15th February we received a notification that our itinerary had changed, and the layover time extended by 18 hours and 20 minutes. Few days later, we received another e-mail informing us that our layover in Doha was extended to 20 hours 35 minutes. They did not offer a hotel room or anything,  as a compensation they offered us a meal voucher.  Check in went ok, boarding was well organised on the first flight in Brisbane but not in Doha. The Boeing 777-300 has a 3-4-3 layout in economy and it was full.  Qatar have a mask policy - however this mask policy was not implemented or enforced. It was mentioned once but staff did not remind passengers they should wear masks. As a result many passengers did not wear masks at all. In Doha the plane had to be reached via a bus.  On the first flight the crew was not very friendly. Food was delicious.    I started flying Qatar Airways last year. I have taken 5 round trips in the last ten months. I fly out of Atlanta. The first two times they used A350-900 non-Qsuite aircraft, both trips were great. From in-flight service to food, everything was top-notch. Then from my 3rd trip and on, they used the older 777 300ERs, they do not have the same seats, and the entertainment system and the screens are very slow to respond. The worst part is when you try to lay down; your feet are always dangling and not even with your body. It feels more like a long recliner than a lie-flat seat.  They offer newer 777s and some even with Q suites on shorter routes, I enjoyed when I flew from Doha to Istanbul or to Dhaka. Why not use these newer aircraft for the long haul flights such as Atlanta to Doha or Doha to Atlanta, where people really need their rest, considering these are 14-hour flights. Their catering service from Atlanta has gone down drastically in the past few months.    After departure they told us that they were out of Taitinger champagne, the main course I wanted was not available, she said you could have ordered your preferred meal before you flight. My diner was nothing specials, very small starter, main course was chicken with rice. After diner we didnÆ’??t see anyone until half hour before arrival. I bought wifi for $10 and thatÆ’??s not a bad price but I expect free wifi in business class. At Doha we went to the lounge, we had to give our names and had to go in line until they call us to enter the dining area. On time we left to the gate to board our flight to Bangkok, at the gate they told us that there was a delay for half hour. Finally it took 1 hour and 45 minutes before we could board the plane without any announcements at the gate. Luckily the service on our flight to Bangkok was better.   Got a bit of a fright at check-in when staff told me I was booked to fly home from Hanoi but I was standing in HCMC airport. Originally booked from Hanoi but i changed departure point two days after i made the booking. I was sent a new e-ticket which confirmed from HCMC and seat number. Upon making the change agent was pretty clear that i should re-issue my ticket via an issue button on the website. Tried this over and over - error message every time. Called them and told problem fixed but I noticed several times that the issue ticket button re-appeared. Emailed Qatar as was concerned by this, they dodged my question. At check in desk was told to call Doha. Got cut off three times whilst being transferred . Fourth call, agent told me to log onto web and click issue ticket button, it didnÆ’??t work. Agent sorted it manually.   The airline facilities were fantastic. It was my first time flying business in the Qsuite with Qatar Airways as I was travelling from australia to Europe. When waiting to board the flight there was no priority lane for business class passengers. Once I had boarded, I would have appreciated a better welcome and more information regarding the services on board. Unfortunately I was mostly ignored by staff when I got into my seat except when I had the do not disturb sign on. I was awakened as the air steward who he needed to know my meal preference. It was a 14 hour flight. I do not understand the urgency from the staff. It defeats the purpose of even having a do not disturb sign.  I was not offered any bedding on the flight.    Business class LHR-BKK, QR832 DOH-BKK, May 16 paid over 60 UK pounds for window seat reservation, changed to 10G middle quad seat without notification. Maybe different plane but why not change to another window seat when they were available. Did get window seat at check-in, seat controls were not working! I should get a refund on the cancelled seat reservation. Shambolic boarding especially at DOH with everyone waiting on the loading gangway for over 30 minutes. Food was the worst I have had on an airline, they seem to think lacto vegetarian is low calories vegetarian, the vegan option was inedible stodge. Staff were very nice.  Flights were on time and uneventful. But IÆ’??ve noticed that Qatar is unable to keep its quality edge over its competitors. It started at BKK airport where they use an inferior contract Lounge since they closed their own lounge indefinitely. The food on board was very mediocre to say the least. There is no more butter for the bread and the main courses were underwhelming in terms of quality and quantity. The beer I had was served at room temperature. The transfer in Doha was the usual chaos at the basement level. The staff wasnÆ’??t very friendly and the bus arrived at the aircraft while the aircraft was still being cleaned. We had to wait in a bus  for 30 min before being allowed to board. This wasnÆ’??t the first time IÆ’??ve experienced this communication chaos using the bus. All in all, I am not willing to pay a premium for flying Qatar anymore. The decline in service, the last minute changes in type of aircraft does not justify the fares it is charging, which is, especially in Premium well above pre Covid times.    Sydney to Doha in February 2022. After being told I would be seated in an empty row by ground staff, I found that the row was not empty at all. I requested a paid upgrade to business at this point, and the staff refused. The staff were just so indifferent. My seat was the one right before the toilet, so that was gross in itself and getting any kind of rest on this  flight proved impossible. My food was quite gross, and was massively downgraded after it being quite acceptable previously. I had only traveled economy with Qatar before, and found it to be pleasant enough, but the quality on this flight had massively dropped.   I checked my suitcase in 2 hours early. Then the flight departed an hour late. Boarding staff kept us all standing around until 15 minutes before the flight was supposed to take off before boarding us. After take off it took staff 2.5 hours to offer me a drink. When we arrived an hour late at Doha, staff rushed us through to the British Airways connecting flight. I still queried how my baggage was going to be rushed to meet the connecting flight and was told it was being taken care of. I arrived this morning in London Gatwick to no suitcase.  I am on my knees praying my bag is found. There were several other people also with missing luggage. Very upsetting.   We chose to fly with Qatar Airways to the Maldives with our two young sons (5 and 8 years old). When we arrived at Heathrow we were informed our flight had only just departed Doha due to technical difficulties, which meant a 7 hour delay at the airport with 2 young children. We were offered a ?Å“40 voucher for the whole family for food and refreshments. We effectively lost a day of our holiday. When we booked our tickets, we ensured we selected flights which had a brief (< 2 hour) stopover in Doha and we paid a premium compared to options with a far longer stopover. Shortly before our holiday we received a notification of a change of flights which meant we now had a 6 hour stopover in Doha for the return journey - something we had wanted to avoid with our 2 young children. I contacted Qatar by telephone (no easy task) to request an alternative flight but this was not possible and no explanation was given for the change. On arrival in Doha, the Qatar Airways transfer staff were unhelpful and not interested in providing us with any lounge access to allow our children to rest (we were in Doha airport from 10pm to 4am local time). We tried numerous lounges at Hamad International Aiport and were willing to pay for access but nobody was able to help us.  We tried to reserve premium seats on some of the flights via the Qatar app, but each time we were unable to complete the additional payment. I contacted Qatar by telephone to reserve our seats but was told I was not able to do this because I booked through an agent (Expedia). I contacted Expedia and was told I needed to contact the airline to reserve Æ’??preferredÆ’?? seats. I contacted Qatar once more and spoke to a different associate who advised me that I could indeed reserve these seats after all. This whole process was convoluted and time consuming and a demonstration of the poor customer interface and lack of staff training. This was our first experience with Qatar Airways and will be our last.    The change in aircraft, makes flying with Qatar unpredictable. I booked a Qsuite, but there was a change in aircraft type, and I ended up with a rather mediocre type of seat. My flight from Warsaw to Doha was ok in terms of food, but the service was not what I was used to. The inflight manager did not greet me as a business class passenger and Platinum member. There was no candle and no salt and pepper dispenser for my lunch. Also, no amenity kit for Warsaw to Doha flights. The Doha to Bangkok flight was better, with a caring inflight supervisor and better service. Unfortunately, I booked a seat close to the galley. The crew was rather lively throughout the night, which kept me awake. Considering that Qatar airfares are already well beyond pre-Covid times, and the fact that cost cutting measures are still in place (e.g. the apparently permanent closure of the lovely flagship lounge at BKK airport), makes me think twice before I book Qatar again.   The seats were comfy and the service during boarding was really good. However the moment the aircraft was in the air the service slowed down, and one needed to buzz them for service. Im not sure what all the staff did back there.   The flight from Cairo to Doha was delayed 2.5 hours. The agent didnt inform me that theyre going to re-book the second fright from Doha to Chicago to later time, making my layover 20 hours instead of 2:45. The agent at the boarding gate at Cairo assured us that well get accommodation taken care of once we arrive in Doha. In Doha, the customer service in the Transfer area was far from professional. They kept us waiting for 2-3 hours in the transfer area, and refused giving us any rooms claiming that Egypt is red listed due to COVID.  They refused to give us access to lounges to get some rest before our 15 hour flight. They said theyre not responsible for what the agents said in Cairo, and they didnt witness the conversation.  3 meal vouchers were added to the boarding pass, two of them worth 30QR, and the third worth 60QR.    Overall experience was very disappointing. Both my flights to and from were delayed and made me miss my connecting flights. They gave my seat to another passenger on my connecting from Doha to Dubai, and the customer service counter was very unfriendly. I had to wait 7 hrs for the next flight, and all they gave was a food voucher for a food court.   I had a complaint, I initially contacted them via Twitter but, all I got was the same message back every time asking for details (which I gave, more than once) and they just followed up again, by asking the same questions. I booked 2 x Business Class tickets for my wife and I, Hong Kong to London via Doha) on January 22nd.  Hong Kong to London was successful but then Qatar Airways cancelled the return journey. The return was London to Hong Kong via Doha on March 29th. I called Qatar Customer Services Team to see what options we had to change the routing of the cancelled flight and / or get a refund and my call was handled by a lady who was poorly informed re any options, and was quite rude and eventually when I questioned her she hung up on me.  I requested a refund but no refund has been received.   My flights between JFK and Doha have been excellent service except for the rock hard bed. Surely a padded mattress could be available. Between Doha and Sydney on much older planes. My return flight from Sydney to JFK no lounges open in Sydney Airport and a $70 voucher to use but only two fast food places were open, the lounge in Doha full but a great shower available. Boarding had passengers herded into a small area with not sufficient seats and no boarding until the last passenger went through security.    At checkin the staff said that we had upgraded to Business class for the DOH-MLE route and hadnt paid, so if we were to continue, we would be charged accordingly. This was not the case. When I quizzed how I could possibly have upgraded without paying, they agreed I couldnt have. A very helpful member of staff re-issued our tickets in economy after phoning reservations and after over an hour stood at checkin. No fault of his and he was a credit to the company. On board I felt the staff were efficient but never over-friendly and it was an hour and a half before we were even offered a drink. The whole experience was mediocre at best.   I wanted to pay and upgrade my seat to one with extra legroom for Doha to Seattle leg, I asked in Chennai Airport and they said they couldnt do it and asked me to do it in Doha airport. At Doha airport they told me it was too late and it cannot be done.    I flew business class from JFK to Doha and first class on to Cairo, Egypt and the cabin service was excellent on both legs.  Upon my arrival in Cairo I found out that my luggage did not arrive with me. After taking quite a bit of time to file the lost luggage paperwork, I was informed that I would have to return to the airport (one hour taxi ride each way) to pick it up myself. Luckily, the suitcase arrived the next day and I had built in an extra day for sightseeing prior to the start of my tour. It took $100 and 5 hours round trip to retrieve my suitcase. I saved the receipts and submitted them to Qatar for reimbursement - and they will not reimburse me because I didnt buy anything. Apparently if I had bought clothing when I was dead tired after close to 24 hours of travel, they might have reimbursed me.  But they didnt tell me this up front. They let me go through the entire process a few times before deciding not to reimburse me. So despite paying for a first class ticket, I had to lose a sightseeing day.   Flight was supposed to depart at 17:45 on February 5th from Zanzibar to Doha but  it actually departed at 23:30. Around 17:30 after Zone 1 was boarded, we see everyone coming back to the terminal. No one told us why, we were asked to take our seats in the terminal again. After approximately 30 minutes we are asked to go to boarding again. After boarding was complete, the pilot made an announcement telling us that he cannot start engine number 2 and that technicians were on the way. He then proceeded to ask us to get off the plane because they needed to completely shut down and reboot the plane and that it would be very uncomfortable for us to be inside the aircraft when that was taking place. He also mentioned that it would be a lot more comfortable for us in the terminal as we would have refreshments and be able to use the facilities. And so we offboarded and onto the terminal.  In the upcoming 4 hours we waited without any information, no update given to us, no one from Qatar was at the gates or in any way present. There was an announcement saying that we will get an update in 30 minutes but that update never came. We asked the airport staff several times and we were told that the staff is on the plane fixing it and that we will get an update. No update came. There was only one shop that only accepted cash for payment.  No update about our flight or the connecting flight that we had missed (QR 0161) or about what to do next. We were ignored and the situation was mishandled. No person from QA or airport staff asked us if we needed anything or offered a glass of water or any piece of information.  We understand and prefer to be offboarded from a faulty aircraft for our own safety, but they were not capable to offer water for 6 hours.    To check in I found the economy class queue was clearing much quicker, they said the business lounge was closed and gave me $70 voucher that no shop in the Sydney airport food court accepted, then they send me on a wild goose chase to find their business lounge in Qatar as no one knew where it was located and was sent on multiple occasions to the wrong lounge. The quality of my food was disgusting with limited options for vegetarians.    Seats are  small. 13 hour flight Montreal to Doha had smaller seats than 45 minute flight Doha to Dubai on the same aircraft A350. That makes no sense. My food was terrible on all flights. Service was mechanical, no friendliness or effort to do more.    
My experience was at best average, and a disappointment after having such high expectations. I purchased extra legroom in the emergency exit row. When I reached my seat during boarding there was the pillow, blanket, amenity kit, and headphones on my seat. I set them down next to my seat on the floor, as there was no where else where I could have access to them while seated. For take off procedures the flight attendant grabbed all of the items and put them into the overhead storage bin away from my seat. When I was able to get up, I could not even locate all of the items. My food was average at best and staff took so long to collect the used meal trays that passengers were bringing their trays to the staff workstation. My one beef with the entertainment system was that they played the same airline/airport commercial every time you watched a new show. When time my flight arrived in Doha we had to exit using stairs and board a shuttle to reach the terminal. And with all of the other COVID rules on masks and cleaning, why would you pack in passengers on a shuttle bus until it is very full. I sent a fairly comprehensive email to Qatar Airways that highlighted my disappointment, received an automated reply from the airline nearly two weeks ago acknowledging receipt of my email but I have heard nothing back since. Perhaps it is the highly rated business class product that is generating the rave reviews. But as for us coach passengers, I donÆ’??t understand how this airline could be number one.    We want to give a huge thanks to Sofia who was the air hostess of our flight QR21 from Manchester to Doha. Her service was outstanding and she went the extra mile and was very attentive and accommodating. People like Sofia make Qatar Airways different from other airlines. We found that our food in business class in Doha to Colombo, Colombo to Doha and Doha to Manchester was not up to standard.   Boarding was messy and delayed with no apologies. The staff dont seem too interested to be in that plane, I was ignored multiple times and each time the male attendant came to our seats hed directly address to the male passengers next to me. My food was also not great, ran out of options and Im left with vegetarian food. For a 9hr flight we were served 1 meal and a snack.   Qatar cancelled my flight on 29th Jan, so I had to re-book it. Due to the failure of their online system I wasnt able to do it, so I wrote them a message. My message was ignored for 4 days so I had no other option that to call them, after waiting 30min for someone to pick up the phone, finally my call got answered and flights re-booked for 5th Feb. In the meantime I asked 3 times if the seats that I paid for will be assigned on this new flight and it was confirmed 3 times that they will. I checked my booking online and no seats were assigned. Had to call again and spend another hour to try to sort out situation. She said she is unable to do anything other than give us other seats, I asked for if she can check other flight etc. She wasnt willing to do anything. I had to cancel flights, find another airline and spend extra to solve the problem.   I was booked to fly from London to Singapore via Doha but never got on the plane. 5 days before my flight, I started experiencing Covid symptoms and lateral flow tests showed faint positive results. Tried changing my flight under Manage trips on Qatars site but with the same result; various options are displayed on the calendar but I selected one, the page would indicate There are no flights matching your search. I phoned Qatars UK helpline more than 15 times over several days and downloaded the Rebtel app to call its Doha line. The UK line went dead after I selected the option to speak to customer service and I remained on hold for more than an hour when calling its overseas hotline. I reached out on Twitter multiple times and all I got was an automated response telling me to call the helpline when Id already made it clear Id tried numerous times before and failed to get through. I did not show up for my flight and have not heard from Qatar.  In this era of Covid where travel plans are subject to change due to a volatile situation, travellers need assurance that they can change their flights.    Lost our luggage. Cant get through to anyone for help. My wife and I checked in 4 bags at the same time in Beirut, one of them never made it to Doha.  Reported right away, but it seems nothing is being done to track it down or contact us. Very disappointing and unacceptable - we need that luggage.    Heathrow check had to queue for approx 1.5hrs to check in luggage. Staff was allowing people to jump the queue not realizing that people in queue were all on the same flight. My in flight food was horrible. The cabin staff seemed like she would prefer to be anywhere but on that flight. Inbound  we had checked in online and saved two seats with email confirmation of our choice of seats. When we got to the check in at Male, we were allocated different seats at the back of the plane. When I showed them the email, they didnt understand how I managed to have that email and dismissed the email. The food on the inbound flight was better. We think we will avoid Qatar if we can in the future.   I booked my Business Class ticket to Baku and received the ticket/email on the same day. On the day of travel, I received a phone call telling me that the flight is overbooked and if I can take the next morning flight at 7:30am. I told the Representative that this is not possible as I have Business Commitments early morning next day of travel, then he confirmed that no change will be processed. Upon arrival to the airport hours before departure, I was informed that Business Class is fully booked and there is no seat for me, so I will be downgraded to Economy Class. I objected on tat and he asked me to wait till he tries with other passengers. After more than 45 minutes, he returned back saying it is impossible to be seated in Business Class. I was forced to downgrade to Economy Class and raised a complaint for compensation, but  they offered me $125 which is not even equivalent to the time I will waste to fill the amount of documents they asked for compensation.   Manchester check in not good, disorganised shambles. To travel premium you expect less time to queue this was not the case at Manchester, 45 mins to check in. Flight then delayed after passengers hit the gate area, no social distancing, no queue control between passengers.  Onboard Qsuite is ok, lacks the little touches of other Middle East carriers such as Emirates; dine on demand was a no for me, drinks glasses are collected but I was not asked if a refill On arrival in Doha it was a dash to the lounge to grab a shower, but refused entry to the business lounge as the flight was due for boarding in 20 minutes. So off we go to the gate, 1 hour later still sat there and flight again late. Crew ask what you want for breakfast at this stage itÆ’??s was 8 hours away. I asked can I order after take off, no was the answer as limited food on board. Arrive in Cape Town to be meet at the gate  sorry u have no bags, go to lost luggage and fill out a form. 1st 2 days of the break trying to find out where the bags are, had to go buy essentials and clothes. After 36 hours bags arrived, no compensation. Day 6 we receive a schedule change for the departure is pushed back a day, day 9 another email to say the flight has been cancelled due to operational reasons and we apologise for any inconvenience caused. You can benefit from the flexible re-booking policy and change your travel date or destination free of charge within the same booking class (fare difference will apply), or request a refund for the value of your ticket to the original form of payment with no penalties or refund fees. Only problem as Qatar has already changed the flights no changes according to the system can be done, so itÆ’??s refund number 2 with Qatar and rebook with BA.   Check in fine. Boarding awful with not enough seating. Early snack a dry egg sandwich but full bar service. IFE poor and hard to navigate. Not a spot on regional rivals. My breakfast meal was cold and soggy. But more drinks served. Cabin crew fine. Toilet was a wet mess throughout. Cabin very cold but nice blanket and pillow. Some good things but nothing special. Never had been in all my economy experiences with Qatar.    My flight from Sydney to Doha was delayed for 16 hours because of technical problems.  The staff said Id get my accommodation and transport fees covered but I have got nothing. I had to spend an extra night of layover in Doha and I got no hotel arrangement even though Sydney staff said I would. I would not have taken the delayed flight if I knew U had to suffer an overnight at Doha airport.    Booked a First and business class ticket and website says you can change a booking at no cost before the trip begins. On return leg passing through Doha I wanted to to change the booked flight to an earlier flight. Airline wanted to charge 1500 Euro to change the flight from Doha to Riyadh. I asked to downgrade to economy without paying and they refused. I asked to cancel this first class sector and buy an economy ticket and they refused. It was cheaper to buy a new ticket. I will never fly them again.    Initially my flight got cancelled and my transit time was 1 hour and a few minutes. They gave me a new flight with a transit of 14 hours.  On arrival to Doha, I had paid for a lounge when purchasing my ticket that gives me access to 6hours of the lounge. I had to pay another 55 USD so I can stay till my flight time. I will not be flying this airline in the future.   There is no clear communication on documents to be carried for COVID. We had to do our own research then Qatar forced us to take print outs at an expensive shop in Zurich airport. They dont let you board even if you have 1 document missing. The trip from Doha to Mumbai was on an A320, no space for hand baggage. The flight was congested and dirty.    We have been using Qatar Airways quite a lot and we are happy with the airline. My wife booked a flight to Europe about 15 months ago but due to lockdown she opted for the credit and about a month ago she asked for a refund.  We emailed them asking for refund, the voucher was attached to the email. No response received. We called customer service, we spend 2 hours on the phone but couldnt action the refund instead they told us we will send you an email and ask for banking details No email received within 2 weeks. Called them yesterday; after 2 hour 14 min on hold the call was disconnected.  We emailed yesterday to a few email addresses and we lodged complained via my wifes account. Today an email was received stating; With regards to your concern, please be informed that we have shared your correspondence with our Digital Team.    I contacted the Qatar Airways Call Center in March 2020 to cancel our intÆ’??l flights due to the pandemic and border closures. Turns out, they never processed our flights voucher credits properly (which they admit but still no resolution) and 18 months later we are still waiting. When you call the CC be prepared to be on hold for up to 1.5 hours if you can get into the queue. Numerous attempts to contact/resolve and still nothing. July 2021 CC sent Doha Sr. Mgmt a priority ticket to investigate and was told to call back in 48 hours. Nothing. Then told wait 10 days, then until after the holiday in Qatar, then the CC rep says you will have your new voucher numbers by July 31, 2021 by email. Nothing. Called Aug 14 2021 for update, nothing. Told that CC just initiated a second priority ticket to Doha. They couldnÆ’??t properly register my new email for communication (itÆ’??s changed since original booking). We are out of a lot of $$. 18 months later and still waiting for our voucher numbers that we are entitled to so we can rebook.    Nairobi - Doha - Boston, with a relatively short layover in Doha. The first leg of the flight was delayed and passengers had to miss their connecting flight from Doha, so I had to wait in Doha for a full day and night. Initially, the airport staff told us no hotel would be available, but they will try to get us lounge access, and directed us to the next customer service desk. When I inquired again about lounge access, they told us no lounge is available because the airport is too busy. We gave you a meal voucher though and here is a blanket. You can rest in the Quiet Room. And that was all the service I received for 24 hours. One meal voucher and a blanket. Since airport staff was not helpful, I called the Customer Service line to ask for some form of compensation given that no accommodation was provided, and missing the connecting flight was completely the airlines fault. The staff on the phone questioned me, Are you sure? We have 5 lounges over there. Are you sure they are all full? Did you go to them to check? When I asked about a  flight upgrade  they said We dont do that.    When I arrived at Bangkok airport late at night in time for my 3am flight I was denied boarding because the check-in staff did not acknowledge the entry requirement exceptions even though I had plenty of documentation to prove them with me, even a letter from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I was stranded at the airport and had to make my way to find a hotel in town. Even though my exemption for certain entry requirements has been confirmed by literally every official venue in Italy, Qatar Airways wont acknowledge that I was wrongfully denied boarding and claiming any sort of compensation for their mistake has been an uphill battle of repeated dismissals. I was moved to the next days flight I also didnt get my vegetarian meal.   We were offloaded from the plane as our daughter had no PCR test.  We discussed with the airline staff who told us this is a airline procedure. we were told to call their call centre. it was impossible to reach their call centre. We tried at the airport, we called the local number, their international number and the Dutch privilege card number. I heard endless tapes how flexible and stress free flying with Qatar would be, but no agent. Subsequently i wrote to Qatar, who answered me informing that it was my mistake, and they told me to contact them (referring to the same call centre). We then contacted a travel agent and we got a call from Qatar. They told us that we could book a new ticket and they would deduct the unused legs of the flight, some 750 euro worth. I told them that I would prefer to pay with the voucher they promise on their website: that was not possible, except if I waited 3 weeks. i could could use the remainder of the refund  for the any upcoming flight.   I was not allowed to board my flight from Qatar to Iceland via Denmark. The staff said that transit through Denmark was not allowed for non-EU citizens, when the latest guidelines (Denmark regulations claimed otherwise). The main issue was the almost non-existent customer service to address the issue. I provided an email from the Denmark immigration supervisor stating I can transit through the airport. I provided all this information to staff. The staff then claimed I was denied entry because I did not provide a 48 hr Covid test. I provided records of my  72 hr pcr test and even my vaccination certificate. The staff then told me to call back for a update. To this date, after providing all the justification, I have yet to receive justification why I was not allowed to board my flight after meeting all the requirements, or help in rebooking my flight if a mistake was made. Throughout this whole ordeal, no one from has made any attempts to make contact with me to resolve the issue. All the communication was initiated by me (through numerous phone calls, supplying information on email to both airport operations team and customer care, and visiting the airport customer service desk).    Doha to Chicago on 30th April. Evasive phone numbers, and no customer service email address? Their policy states that if a flight is set back more than 3 hours, other than weather, or an act of God,  you will be refunded. After having to offload and reboard a second plane totalling nearly 4 hours, one would think youd be compensated. Especially after missing the next flight, and setting me back another 9 hours. After countless hours trying to get someone that will actually listen you hear the words, we are not responsible, nor refundable. The rudeness and evasive accountability is astounding.    We didnÆ’??t get to fly with Qatar Airways after booking with them months previously because they were so rigid about their change rules. You can book a Qsuite and the day before the flight they can change it to a regular seat. They will allow you to change to a different flight without a change fee but you would have to pay the difference in fare which for us was $10,000 a person. They will not allow you to mix business and economy seats on any of your fight, any leg or coming back or anything. Since we needed to change just one leg of our flight (Doha to Male) since we had to cancel our stopover in Doha due to COVID and we didnÆ’??t want to pay $20,000 more, we canceled our entire flight at the last minute and booked economy with Emirates who was happy to have us upgrade to Business for just one leg.  I asked why you canÆ’??t mix business and economy and they said itÆ’??s because the baggage fees are different. I said I would pay the baggage fee difference.  I asked why not and she said you canÆ’??t ask why not.  My experience with Qatar Airways was just exceptional. From booking to managing my flight. I had to change my flight date due to unforeseen circumstances and was worried I would have to pay a huge amount to change and would have difficulties in getting my request done. However they sorted out my enquiry speedily and at no extra charge (I got the same ticket a week later). Furthermore the staff was so friendly and kind and they provided me with my requested vegetarian meals with no hassles. I would really recommend flying Qatar any day and I will definitely be flying Qatar on my next flight! Great job everyone!   I have used Qatar Airways for the most of my travels. But recently they have done something that is opposed to being a good airline. They have marketed on their webpages that tickets that are booked prior to 31 of December 2020 can be rebooked/changed unlimited times free of charge. Due to this benefit I have booked on Qatar Airways. But now when I want to change the ticket, delay my flight back to Stockholm a week or more they are asking for the fare difference which is 300-500USD. I paid my original ticket for 900USD with the intention to have flexibility with my return date but they say that only service fee is free but not fare price.    I was due to fly back home to Doha from Istanbul via Qatar Airways. I had all of my COVID-19 documents in order to board my flight. This consists of a negative PCR test and a medical certificate that makes me eligible for home quarantine in Doha. However, Qatar Airways staff at the Istanbul airport refused to let me board my flight. I called customer service and they told me that the Qatari government regulations are wrong and that I should call the Ministry of Public Health and inform them of that. After several conversation, it was clear that Qatar Airways staff were coercing me to book a hotel for quarantine on Discover Qatar. I was forced to book a flight home on another airline and add an extra night of expenses. They refused to refund my ticket. This convoluted hotel quarantine police they have isnÆ’??t written anywhere on their website, neither is the refund claim they make.   The flight out to Thailand was great. However the return flight was cancelled due to Covid. Qatar Airways was offering a change of date in place of return flight or refund or voucher. I recently contacted Customer services to arrange my return flight this has been very difficult and Ive been told that they issued me with a voucher without me requesting this option. I have tried to have this rectified to enable me to book the return flight home to replace the original cancelled flight. The customer services have not been helpful in regard to this option, they now want to charge me a further amount for return flight offering the voucher value as discount on the ticket I require. After further discussions as to why a voucher was issued they inform me that another party had requested this without my consent or knowledge. Despite this they tell me that they are unwilling to put the error right and issue me with a return ticket.
   We flew Sydney-Doha-London business class. Wed not flown business before so we thought we would treat ourselves, our bookings were made well in advance pre-Covid. Due to the restrictions on flying our flight got pushed back until we finally got clearance to fly one year after our initial booking and six months after our intended flight. Changing our tickets was simplicity and the person dealing with the change was very helpful. Checking in at Sydney was average with the check in staff doubling up with gate duties, there were only four flights departing Sydney that evening so they werent exactly rushed off their feet. The flight was uneventful which is how you want it. The service was exemplary, very attentive and the food was delicious with plenty of it. The seat although lie flat wasnt as comfortable as I was expecting and on the 14 hour flight I got somewhere between 2-3 hours of sleep. The in flight entertainment was average with few major movies available. We had three hours at Doha before catching our onward flight to Heathrow and we used most of the three hours in the spacious lounge refreshing ourselves. The onward flight was a repeat of the first flight, generally pleasant with the same caveats as before. Overall the onboard experience was very good. But what marred the flight was after we got to our isolation destination to find out an expensive electrical item had been badly damaged despite it being marked as fragile. Qatars response was effectively tough, thats the terms of service that we had signed up for and they declined to take responsibility or consider my claim for damages.    After nice business class trip from Frankfurt to the Maldives my husband and I decided to buy-up both legs of our flight on the way back home. This cost us an extra $2100.00. Upon arriving in Doha we were informed that the upgraded ticket doesnt include lounge access. This is the first time in all of my flights that I have been told that paying to upgrade doesnt get you lounge access. We paid for a full fare business class ticket in the end, we just paid it via an upgrade and did it for two extra legs of the trip. (Currently sitting in the transit lounge, as we luckily have other lounge accesses). Its true that in fine print at the bottom of the email under the upgrade here you will find that the upgrade doesnt allow lounge access - however, they hide it.    After a two and a half hour delay (not even a water offered) there was a further delay at our transit point. I was told that my plane had left and there was a flight in several hours to my country but not my destination as they only fly there once a week. There was not even an apology offered. The staff told me itÆ’??s up to myself to find pay for a connecting flight in our country even though IÆ’??d paid Qatar in full for a ticket to my destination! After much demand they agreed to sort the final leg of our trip. We were again in our several ours at transit destination not offered anything. We had to demand some food and water and it was a fight to get a bit of airplane food and water!    This review is not about the flight itself, its about the customer service of Qatar on the ground. Qatar tries to catch customers with promotions like getting 3 x QPoints or 5 x QMiles Because of a promotion, I book my flight with Qatar Airways in Business Class. Due Covid-19 everything was cancelled and I agreed to receive a voucher. Now I rebooked my flight, again in Business Class, but the amount of my voucher was not enough, I had to pay also some extra costs. There is currently a promotion active which lets you earn many bonus miles - so I contacted Qatar if I will be able to collect these miles. The answer was no. You booked this flight with a voucher from an earlier, cancelled flight, so I am not eligible for the current promo. If this depends on the initial flight, I was eligible to earn 3 x QPoints from the previous flight?  I want to clarify that the service on board is still amazing, the crews do a great job. But on ground, the customer service is just a shame.   I bought a ticket from Melbourne to Tallin with Qatar airways and airBaltic, which was cancelled twice. After being able to rebook the flight for the third time I was on my way. At Stockholm my connecting airBaltic flight was cancelled. The staff at the airport was no help and told me to contact the airline. After being on the wait list on the phone for over an hour Qatar airways representative told me that there was nothing they were able to do. I was stranded in Stockholm with no possible flight to continue my trip, they would not give me a refund or  accommodation. After spending hours in the airport I was able to continue my journey with a ticket I had to purchase myself with no help from Qatar.   My husband booked a ticket for myself and kids from their website. We received a confirmation email from them with our etickets. I tried to contact Qatar Airways via phone at their listed airport number for two weeks to inquire and add our pet to our reservation.  Also tried reaching out on their facebook page but still no answer. We ended up leaving our pet behind. Upon arriving at the airport, the agent informed me that my husbands credit card should be present for verification. I told them that I had the same credit card with the same account number/credit card number because we share the same account but my card is under my name. They refused it and were about to send me back home. The supervisor informed me that an email was sent to us for credit card verification. I informed them that I did not get such an email. I contacted my husband who was in the US and he also did not get an email. I quickly searched my junk mail and found that it was sent to me the day before the flight. I sat in the airport and submitted all required documents online (luckily I had all what they required available). We waited for QA customer support to verify but they did not. They tried to call them from the airport but they did not answer and they did not even reply to the emails they were sending. The supervisor then told me that the only option left was for me to put down another payment and once they finish the credit card verification, then theyd refund me. I used the same credit card and we were on our way. At Doha airport (transit) I seemed to remember leaving behind my expensive headphones hanging on the hand of my seat. I immediately asked a QA agent to have a staff member get it for me since i was not allowed back onto the plane. The agent called the lost and found office instead and got no answer. He assured me that theyd send it for me once found. I told him that I was still here at the airport and it would be quick to just get it now, he did not seem able to help. At Los Angeles airport, they seemed to have lost one of my luggage. The agents there assured me that all luggages were transferred and were onboard and another customer has grabbed my bag. I filed a missing bag form and they called me the next day to inform me that it was found. Upon inquiring where the bag was at, the agent told me that it was left behind in Beirut airport. Once I got home, I checked my credit card and found that the two charges for our airline tickets were both cleared. I emails customer support and until this moment did not receive my refund. I had to file a dispute with my credit card and since I had all proof that I was double charged, my credit card has immediately refunded my money back. They found my headphones and I have to drive to nearest airport to get them. Their inflight service is good, however not worth the headache they put me through.   Booked my daughter a return from UK to Perth and was informed post booking that from 15 1/2 they are no longer classed as minors so shed have to find her own way through the airport. I wasnt comfortable with that especially during covid so booked and paid for a rather expensive accompanied and assist while transiting through. They took her to a lounge and left her there and someone else came later to assist her to flight, no real issues. I realised while checking in on the way back to the UK that the accompanied on the ticket didnt include the return leg which I asked for and assumed with the price paid was completed. We checked at the desk and said hed sorted it out and all was arranged. She landed in Qatar and was told by the staff on the plane to speak to the staff as she got off which she did. They proceeded to tell her nothing was arranged and to find her own way.    London to Auckland via Doha on 31st May. My flight was cancelled and no alternative flight was offered. I was told I could claim a refund, but I have still not received it. Have been told it could take up to 3 months for a refund.   I and my wife had Business Class tickets. I was offered an upgrade in the app on checkin for my 3 daughters. After paying for it I realised that the upgrade was only for the segment from Doha to Zurich.  I therefore requested either an upgrade for the whole trip or a refund of the amount paid and return to economy. Customer service (center not managed by Qatar) answered that I was wrong and I should have read the terms and conditions. Refused any of the two options.  In Doha we try and access the Business Class lounge. No access for my children as the tickets were upgraded and not full Business class. Qatar Airways website places the cost of access to the lounge at 450dr 59% off for children. No mention of the fact that an age restriction applies to minors between 12 and 17 which are not considered children. All these rules applied in a very strict manner with no flexibility.   The plane from Bangkok to Doha was decent enough but the Boeing 777-300ER from Doha to LHR was shocking. Mould on the ceiling and interior, badly cleaned surfaces.  Will not use them again in the future unless they improve. The airport was decent enough. Im giving them a score this high because of the onboard staff who did the best they could.   Although I booked an aisle seat, I was given a middle seat at check-in without anyone mentioning the change, so I had the surprise when I boarded the plane. The flight attendants were very nice and apologetic and tried to find a solution but since the flight was full there wasnt much they could do. I am aware that sometimes there is a last minute change of aircraft and all the seats are changed, but I believe this was not one of these situations because my neighbours on either had the seat they had booked even before I booked mine. I strongly suspect that this happened when I upgraded my return flight to business class, a glitch in the system cleared my seat selection for the outbound journey. I wrote to Qatar Airways about it, and they replied that they are free to change seats at any time, including after boarding. There wasnt enough food, 2 meals and one sandwich, and my vegetarian ovo-lacto meal was a vegan meal. There also seemed to be some confusion among the staff, a couple of times they served me a regular meal and then took it away to give me the special meal. The flights were on time, IFE was good and the flight attendants were very nice.   London to Doha was average. Food quality has gone down and entertainment was pretty average with no new movies. Doha to Kochi was with a no-frill airline Indigo from Doha to Kochi. This was absolutely horrible, seats were thin and very uncomfortable, no entertainment, my food was absolutely horrible and staff could not care less. Qatar trying to make a profit by providing customers with a no-frill service is unbelievable and not acceptable. After landing in Doha, we had to take a 25 minute bus ride from the plane to the airport.    The first leg of this flight was on the A380 and the second was on a Boeing 787. The A380 was full booked and itÆ’??s a remarkable aircraft. Food was terrible on both flights. On the second flight I was starving and was disappointed when all I was given as my first meal was a sandwich. Then the breakfast was inedible. The crew on the flight didnÆ’??t seem to get on with each other. Rather unprofessional. Wi-Fi didnÆ’??t work. In flight entertainment is superb, credit where credit is due. WasnÆ’??t impressed with Qatar on my last couple of flights.  Staff good. Food ok. Seat comfort on 787 absolute zero. Im 6ft 4 . No room for me at all and the person in front trying to push the seat back to recline. You can pay for a reserved seat at nearly ?Å“100 per flight. Adverts when you try to watch movies.   Cabin staff service: Inflight staff is very inexperienced or there is not enough staff. Most of the passengers have complained about inflight service. They were not able complete the food service also on time. Food : For the long term flight food also very bad. Most of the people are not eating some particular items. May be airline can identify this item and remove this item from the menu.   We booked 2 business seats to Europe and we had to pay to choose our seats. I paid $989.80 to select seats. We were supposed to be on Qsuites, one of the reasons we booked with Qatar. On the First leg from Athens to Doha they changed our plane to one that didnt have Qsuites. The seats they allocated us were at the rear on the business cabin, very noisy. As we didnt get the seats we paid for I thought they would offer us a refund for the money we paid to select seats . When we got home I waited for a few days and when I didnt hear from them I contacted them via email. They refused to compensate for the downgrade from Qsuites and they wanted me to sign an Indemnity and Waiver of Liability Form to refund the money I paid for a service they didnt supply. They should refund the fee they charged for seat allocation on this leg.    I paid $88 USD extra for an exit row seat with extra leg room, based on the Qatar Airways seat map during online purchase. But my seat was not in an exit row. I assumed that the aircraft had been changed at the last minute and that the airline would refund the fee. After complaining to Qatar Airways twice, they denied that there was anything wrong.    Qatar Airways has good service on board and the seats are quite comfortable. The airport is also nice to explore. I flew twice now with Qatar but this time we had a delay already in Entebbe of 3 hours then lost the connection flight and had to wait 8 hours in Doha. I asked for a hotel room or a  food voucher or anything. We were forced to wait around and sleep in lounge chairs. This was not acceptable and for a waiting time, lost hotel and lost day in Vienna I expected at least an apology.   July 2023. Family of 5 with 3 children, pre-booked extra leg room seats and so that we could be together. Our seats were reallocated to a group as we transited through Doha airport. We ended up with seats spread across the entire the aircraft, nowhere near each other. Our 13 year old whoÆ’??s afraid of flying was sick with the stress caused, and to us as parents worried that if something happened there was no way we could have taken care of our 3 children. Total lack of interest, no customer care, no customer service, no attempt to improve the situation, then lies and fabrication of reasons when we complained at the gate, onboard and afterwards to their customer care team. First they claimed the aircraft had been changed, then that our seats were changed for operational reasons, and then best of all claiming we had missed our flight and had been put on a different plane. Because we complained, we never got a refund for the extra leg room seats.   Flight hostesses didnt acknowledge or greet me as I walked to get seated. There are 2-3 hostesses standing by their assigned section who dont acknowledge or greet you, and if they do its forced and fake. They give juice/water and if you return it when they come to collect it and you say thank you they didnt acknowledge.    I booked to fly Qsuite business from Jakarta to Athens return. On checking in at Jakarta International airport we had to stand and wait for an hour.  When I raised my concern with the staff, they said it was because they have three flights departing at that time.  The lounge was the Garuda Business lounge that was really awful. The only alcoholic beverages available were unpalatable and inferior products.  The ghastly food offering was substandard and inedible. The lounge was cramped, hot and overcrowded. We left the lounge and used the general access / food court section and bought a decent glass of wine and better food. Four weeks before my return flight, Qatar emailed me to say I can not return from Doha to Jakarta in Qsuite because they changed aircraft to one without Q Suite. If If I still want to fly Qsuite, I must catch an alternative flight 7 hours later and wait 9 hours in Doha rather than about 2. Their rules state that I am unable to enter the Doha business lounge until a few hours before my flight, so the rest of the time, I would be locked out of the lounge. As to their email apology to me for moving my fight to a plane without Q Suite, they said I could choose my own seat in the new plane to get the seat of my choice. I tried. And they will not allow me to book my seat until 48 hours before the flight.    At the online check-in when they give me the availability to choose a seat for free on the middle or the aisle side on my return ticket, both ways. If I wanted to have the window side I had to pay an extra fee. The most disappointing was the food, we had 2 options chicken rice and braised beef when they come to me they didnt have beef anymore, so I  had to take the chicken biryani. No butter or cheese was served.  On the online check-in counter in Muscat i waited more than 25 minutes because one family had immigration issues, since only 1 counter was available.   The seats felt like auditorium seating, Ok for 20 minutes but leave your bottom numb for anything longer. The seating was simply just too small and packed in and the cushioning was basically non existent. Sitting on the isle I was kicked, bumped and stood on nearly every time a staff member came past. This was supposedly in a seat that gave me more leg room and I paid extra for.     It pains me to share this experience as I have always been a big fan of Qatar, having flown on it many times in my career while based in Washington DC and Geneva (business and first class). And, in fact, paid the extra money to upgrade to business class when I retired and returned to South Africa with my wife during the pandemic and it was expertly handled and a very satisfying, secure experience. Checked in at Schipol around noon on Tuesday 26 September travelling QR0274 to Doha, then QR1369 to Cape Town on Wednesday 27 September. Checked in three bags, two were received, and one was not. Reported at CPT on arrival on 27 September and a property irregularity report completed with appropriate supporting information including pics. Since then it has been a nightmare of correspondence and communication with various people in CPT, DOHA and AMS. All to NO avail. No one seems to have the capability, willingness or interest in helping a customer retrieve their missing bag containing valued personal possessions, including our family Holy Bible which is irreplaceable. Apparently the missing bag apparently was traced in AMS and was meant to be loaded on QR0274/29 September to be delivered in CPT on QR1369/30 September. Nothing arrived and there seems to be complete confusion between CPT and Qatar representatives in Doha and AMS. It seems AMS are not responding but I find it hard to believe that Qatar would not physically investigate what is going on at AMS with their baggage handlers, whom I believe are Swissport. I tried Swissport and the Station Manager in AMS but they dont answer their phones. I keep being assured that the bag is on the next flight but nothing. It is now a week since the missing bag was traced and it is just endless communication with people who want nothing to do with the problem and passing the blame to someone else. No one is willing to show any initiative or take accountability.  Flew from Singapore - Doha - Milan Return, out bound flights were great but Doha to Singapore was bad, After three hours of sleep, I went to put the Qsuite up and it broke, got up out of my seat and tried to fix it and there was no interaction from the crew until I rang the bell. Flight attendant came and said that it was my fault as my shoes were under the seat. Seat was then adjusted to a ridiculous position which was uncomfortable to sit in. Breakfast came and flight attendant tried to set up table but could not be done due to position of seat, left me sitting there before I complained to the cabin services manager. They try to fix it, they managed to manually position seat for me but only a few hours to landing. Qatar complaints was hopeless saying staff did everything possible and they blamed turbulence on the flight for not attending to seat first. Offered me 10,000 avios as compensation.    First time on Qatar using BA miles. I find it hard to understand why this airline is so appreciated. ItÆ’??s no better than any other. Food is average with hot drinks not being served with breakfast due to the danger of spilling. Half the cabin crew are good and efficient, the other half are not. The A350 is good and comfortable with sufficient legroom, the 787 less so.    This has been my first flight on Qatar in Y class since the onset of the pandemic and it was a huge disappointment. The catering was among the worst I had in a long time. They were not even half way through the cabin, when only one choice of meal was available. The minced beef with mashed potatoes were poor in taste and presentation. Bread rolls were  replaced by corn bread. No butter provided. The service was very slow and finally ended 3.5h after takeoff. The seats were narrow and uncomfortable. Considering the price IÆ’??ve paid, and what I got in return, I will not fly Qatar again until it returns to its old standards of service and catering.  I have flown with them before and it used to be the best airlines where flight attendants were so warm and welcoming. Today I flew again with them and the all the interactions I had from check-in to my Flight attendant, everyone was just so passive aggressive. The seats are still nice with amazing space and amenities but the crew level has come down significantly.   From an epic experience to merely average. Have flown with QR many times long haul and Q suite is epic and unbeatable. However 4 recent trips to Istanbul in business class including the most recent reduce it to very average. The plane is a leased ex Cathay 777 still sporting the green flashes of Cathay, circa 11 years old and feels it. My major gripe is around service and food and beverage. On such a short circa 3.30 hour flight it was pedantic, why have stellar wine list if staff do not actively ask me if I want a refill let alone ask if I would like any at all. The food was sub par with a tough overcooked steak no coffee service no follow up no greeting and no goodbye.   Seats are too narrow, no space for my legs. Transfer in Doha was complicated and unfriendly personnel. Boarding was chaotic. Will not fly Qatar Airways again.    Mahe - Doha. Allows 23kg + 7kg hand luggage per person. We had 1x large suitcase weighing 27kg and we had to repack twice even though we were under the permitted weight of 46kg. The lady and supervisor at check-in say there is no other way.  Mah?? - Doha. Erlaubt 23kg + 7kg Handgep??ck pro Person. Wir hatten 1x grossen Koffer mit 27kg und wir mussten 2x umpacken obwohl wir insgesamt unter den erlaubten 46kg lagen. Dame und Supervisor am Check-in sagen es geht nicht anderst.   I cover my checked bag with a cloth envelope to prevent it from scuffing. This flight plan involved a local carrier from Durban to Joburg and then Qatar to Doha then Chongqing. On my return flight, the plane was delayed for over an hour, due to mechanical issues in Doha. Consequently, by the time I landed in Joburg OR Tambo airport, passed through passport control, and picked up my baggage, my connecting flight was boarding. As OR Tambo re-check baggage was no longer operational, I had to rush to departures to check in my bag. The time was so time that the airline employee had to check with her supervisor to see if it could be loaded. I rushed through domestic security and was among the last passengers to board. When I landed in Durban, I had a chance to check my luggage and noticed damage. I complained at Durban airport and to Qatar. Qatar kept repeating that when I was in OR Tambo, I should have checked my luggage and filed a written damage report, which would have caused me to miss my plane.   Overall, it was okay. The food was pretty good, leg room was acceptable (wouldnt say the best though), customer service was good. The seats however, were really uncomfortable, they were very thin and had next to no padding which on a 14 hr flight, followed by a 7hr flight was brutal. We couldnt wait to get off. After this we flew, Cathay Pacific, ANA, and Jetstar, Ive also flown Emirates, Air NZ, Qantas, LATAM, and Virgin, so I have a lot to compare it to. Id only fly with them again if they were significantly cheaper then competitors.   My in-flight entertainment system did not work at my seat for the 8h+ flight. I flagged this to the flight attendants which attempted to fix it to no avail, so I had no entertainment. I raised this with customer services upon my return home as in my opinion I did not receive the service I paid for, and I would expect a part refund however I was met with a half apology and fabrications. I was told that according to their reports I was offered an alternative seat which I refused.   I booked a round-trip flight from MXP to BKK via DOH that, on paper, should have been very comfortable: 1-2-1 configuration on the first leg and Qsuites on the second leg. The day before travelling I received the email from Qatar Airways, informing me of the change of aircraft. I understand that, in certain circumstances, airlines have to change aircrafts for operational reasons from time to time, but when this happens and ends up in a sort of downgrade, it becomes quite annoying. The DOH-BKK flight, originally equipped with Qsuites, was replaced by an old 777 with a 2-2-2 configuration. I had to sleep on a very uncomfortable angled bed. Qatar Airways, in the email sent to me the day before the departure, wanted to emphasize two things:  If I wanted to keep the Qsuites, I could change dates for free; I obviously contacted them immediately and they proposed an alternative to me, but they told me that I would have to pay another 2700 EUR. I dont quite understand the meaning of free in it. Alternatively, despite the lack of Qsuites, I could still take advantage of all the luxury and comfort of Qatar Airways. My attempts to obtain a partial refund, even in the form of Avios were completely ignored.  The in flight staff was not attentive at all. Requested mango juice as part of lunch, never arrived. The attendant never came to offer me snacks or drinks. Paid 1200?Å“ for a economy ticket, but received a below average service from this staff. Its their responsibility to attend every customer during the flight, they failed badly with me.   Following a downgrade of my flight Bali to London from business to a seat first in Economy and then a seat without power or possibility to move it, Qatar Airways offered me a ridiculous compensation of 10k avios worth 100$. No alternative business flight was offered and the compensation is an insult given the price of the ticket.   When I arrived at my departing airport, Baltimore Washington, my flight was cancelled for my first leg due to bad weather. This part of the flight is with American Airlines. American had no other flights leaving BWI for the rest of the day and I needed to get a connecting flight from Chicago to Doha. They only could offer a flight leaving the next nearest airport 40 miles away w/ no way to get there and it would also change my return flight to that same airport. This was not an option for me so I decided to make a last-minute decision to fly another airline that was flying out of BWI at a cost. I figured I could get refunded for that part of the flight from Qatar or even American - sadly not. American told me that Qatar would have to refund it. On the ground at the airport in CHI, it was a mess. It took an hour to get through check-in. While weather was bad, there were enough agents. Getting to the gate and waiting to board wasnt a problem. I got an upgraded seat in economy class that had plenty of space. My return flight I picked the same seat and had another seatmate with an upgraded experience. Now between these two fights Id say the first wasnt as bad because the attendant also gave me my food right after my seatmate. Shouldnt be an issue , since you have the cart of food right there. Why on the return flight I didnt get my meal until the attendant came back after he went up to the front of the plane. Inflight entertainment was top notch. There were plenty of movies, TV shows and music. The internet was choppy w/ my device so I just stayed w/ the entertainment they provided. I also think the food was great. I enjoyed all meals and they were portioned just right. As for the issue of my refund, Im still fighting.   No complaints about the service or products onboard. However, they lost my bag at JFK for a week, and when I had to waste a day of my own vacation time to go buy some clothes, they refuse to fully reimburse me and I had to chase and jump through hoops to get any compensation offer from them.  It has been few months, and I have not gotten anything yet. All this over a couple hundred dollars; its utterly disgraceful.  Service was ok, pretty good on my aisle and extremely slow where my wife was seated. Layout was good, but not exceptional, IÆ’??d rate them maybe 7/10. Landing in Doha, we then had quite a long wait for steps to be brought to the aircraft and then a 10 to 15 minute bus ride to the terminal. There is a lot of competition for routes from Europe to Australasia and think IÆ’??ll pick one of the other options in future.   I have sent 5 emails and have only received 2 automatic response emails after initiating our complaint 10 weeks ago. I have sent all of the relevant documentation to support our claim for a refund. Our group of 3 booked adjoining Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck of an A380 from Doha to Perth after a connecting flight from Amman. We paid for our Exit Row seats on August 22 2023 and received email confirmation that day. What was a shock to us is that when we were at Amman airport we got our tickets for the second leg, from Doha to Perth, we saw that we had been seats on the lower deck. We said this was wrong and showed our August confirmation for seats 30 A, B and C on the upper deck. We were told by Qatar Airways staff in Amman that it could only be fixed up in Doha. We were also told that the reason was that the plane had been changed from an A380 (which was not correct) . Our connecting flight from Amman to Doha was not only cancelled but deleted altogether meaning we had a 10.5 hour transit instead of the original 2.5 hours. Then at the Boarding Gate in Amman we were informed that there were 2 Exit Row seats available in the Upper Deck and that these had been put on hold for us and to see the Qatar Ground staff in Doha. We were in a queue for almost an hour at the Qatar Service Desk in Doha. I asked how the seats we had booked and paid extra for in August, and provided emails and a hard copy to verify this, were no longer available for us? We were told that it was a system error. There was no apology at all for the system error. We were further disappointed to find out that the 2 Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck that we had been told by staff at the boarding Gate at Amman had been reserved were not actually retained for us and that only 1 Exit Row seat was available. Understandably we were not happy that we did not receive the Exit Row seats that we had booked and paid for more than 3 months prior. Through no fault of our own we were victims of a Qatar Airways system error. We did not complain to the flight attendants on the Doha to Perth flight as we understood that they had no control over the seat allocation. However, we politely asked the people in seats 30A and 30B, that we had paid for in August, when they had purchased their seats and were informed that they had done so about 2 weeks prior. I chose Exit Row seats on the Upper Deck because of the extra space and the cabin configuration of 2 by 4 by 2 seats and because my wife and I would be seated next to each other and the other member of our group would be in the next available Exit Row seat. Instead of all being seated next to each other in Exit Row seats we were split up and certainly didnÆ’??t get what we paid for. Plus all of the wasted time trying unsuccessfully in Amman and then at the Transit Desk in Doha to sort out the error created by Qatar Airways assigning our seats to someone else. It is bad enough that we didnÆ’??t get 2 of the Exit Row seats that we had paid for that were allocated to other people who booked well after us. What is worse is that there has been no attempt by Qatar Airways to address our complaint let alone issue the refund to which we are entitled. Our complaint isnÆ’??t complex.    They convinced me that I needed to pay $1500 to add my middle name to my flight, or they wouldnt allow me on the plane. When I got to the airport, they didnt put my middle name on the ticket and I didnt have any issues. I paid $2300 to upgrade our seats to business class from Doha to Montreal. Not even an hour into the flight, the seat reclined on its own, pinching my leg. The seat wouldnt stay up the rest of the 13.5 hour flight."
Singapore Airlines, "Flight I had with Singapore Airlines are late by up to 90 mins on arrival.  ItÆ’??s inferior to Qatar Airways business class : underwhelming lounges, okay onboard catering, no dining-on-demand, quirky flat-bed seats (on the A350ULR and more so on the new A380), meager amenities onboard. The cabin crew is somewhat the only part of Singapore Airlines nearly on par with Qatar Airways.   My flight started on March 18 KUL-FRA and we were asked to check in our Baby stroller at the gate and we will get it in Germany. The food was not same as before and the quality is pretty bad. Upon arrival we were informed that our stroller did not make the flight and it was delay for 3 days. Worse part when the stroller was return it was damaged. On our return flight April 15 FRA - KUL We found out that our original seats which was bassinet seats were changed and we had to go to the airport early to make sure that my baby has a bassinet. This was very frustrating for us with a 1yr old baby. We were also ask to check in at the gate another bag that contains my baby items as it was too big to go into the overhead cabin as per the crew.  Upon check in we were move to the back side on the aircraft not the seats we booked. The food was not good as well and too far in between for a 12hr flight, the crew was helpful but not regularly offering drinks /snacks not sure if that is the new standard. Meals was served less than 1hr before landing and the crew was rushing the meals. Upon arrival at Singapore a delay on our bags, so we had to wait and check at the airport longer just to get some clarification. They didnt know where our bags are and just informed us that it will be delivered home. Once my baggage was delivered, my luggage was damaged and unusable wheels caved in and the fragile sticker gone.    Our flights were all delayed and the transfers at Changi Airport were not smooth. Going flight on 14 April 2023 SQ929 SUB-SIN, the departure from Surabaya was delayed. When arrived in Changi Airport, we could not get on our flight to Haneda, and our flights were changed to Narita. The airport change caused longer travel time (from Haneda to home is less than 1 hour but from Narita is more than 2 hours) and cost (from Haneda is about 500 yen but from Narita is about 4500 yen). Return flight on 16 April 2023, SQ631 HND-SIN flight arrival to Changi Airport was delayed. While we could make it to connection flight to Surabaya, our luggage could not. We were disappointed with Singapore Airlines.   There were no manned counters available for economy class at all. Even 2.5 hours before the flight, no staff were available to assist us and staff in Perth airport were not familiar with the self check in kiosk issues. We took a good 2 hours to resolve our check in issues as there was a long line of people waiting in line as all of us had issues checking in via the online kiosks. There were only 2 staff walking around who arrived only 2 hours before flight. We were juggling the queue, our toddler, baggage and when we finally printed our boarding pass, we had to lug everything and our toddler who was cranky at this point from all the waiting and standing and queueing and then self check in our baggage one at a time. It was the worst service ever. Also the captain announced that there will be no wifi for that flight.    Frankfurt to Singapore on Singapore Airlines SQ325, 23 February 2023. 1st drink service served on trays with cups of water or juice & pack of mixed nuts instead of the drink trolley. 1hr+ into a 12hr flight, dinner was served. When it was my turn, I asked for a beer with my dinner but was told there was no more beer onboard explained staff. This flight felt a lot like Scoot.   Terrible seats. We had no space for our legs due to boxes fixed under the seats in front of us. My girlfriend had these boxes fixed in front of her, leaving her only 60% of space for her feet. Myself had only 70% of normal feet space for economy class.   The ground crew were unreasonable and very rude. We were denied boarding as according to them we were 4 minutes late.  The ground crew did a lousy job of offloading our luggage. We had to wait almost half a day in the baggage carousel before filling a missing bag report.   I miss the pre-pandemic Singapore Airlines. I have flown with them on a regular basis for decades and am disappointed at how bad the first flight I took with them since the pandemic was. My flight was purchased from Air Canada and AC is the first marketing carrier as per US DOT rules. AC is also the most significant carrier. I have clearly researched my baggage allocation prior to the trip and packed appropriately. Unfortunately, the SIA check in staff were clearly unaware of their own companys baggage policy (see pictures below) and refused to allow me to check my three bags. I had to repack my bags at the airport, which is both embarrassing and a complete hassle. I have never had to do this in my decades of leisure and business travel. I will definitely think twice before taking a flight with SIA again in the future.  Was this a memorable flight? Not really. I like the entertainment selection. The seat was fine for just over a 2 hr flight on SQ177. Actually not much different to the 350-900 medium haul except maybe the adjoining two seats in the middle are closer. The food. Oh my. Dreadful. Sounded great, lemongrass chicken. It was very fatty and unpleasant. The bok choy was almost raw. I would have preferred a plateful of the garlic bread instead of the tiny slice I was given. All in all it was a very average experience. I miss the Singapore Airlines pre Covid and really think they need to up their game in the food area especially. I booked this flight as at the time it was actually cheaper to go to HCMC via Singapore than just to Singapore. However, I wish I booked through Vietnam Airlines and saved money and connection hassles.  Overall an ok flight. Lounge - SilverKris Changi is huge and was too over crowded. We had to sit at a canteen type table which was uncomfortable. We only stayed long enough to change our sim and change clothes. Way too busy. Gate/Boarding. We got in line. Was told there was no point as it hadnÆ’??t opened. We stayed in line as seats get taken in there fast. Boarding passes are scanned after security which meant the one gate agent could not cope when it was boarding time and everyone stormed the gate not adhering to groups or priority. Seat - narrow. Overhead lockers were too high for me to reach even with the little foot aid thing. Others had to help. No other storage except under the foot rest. There is a tiny cubby hole where ear phones, menu and water bottle were kept. Not a comfortable seat to sleep in being so narrow with no wriggle room. Hard being a side sleeper. Food - As all my other flights had poor quality food I opted for no meal, just sleep. The passenger in front argued with the FA over no breakfast service. Personally I believe there should have been a choice but no. The lovely FA verified no meal with me and offered to keep cheesecake aside that she would serve to me with coffee when I woke which was lovely of her. As I woke an hour or so before landing she was right there with what was promised. On arrival luggage arrived quickly so we were one of the first through customs with no long line. Overall the crew really are the highlight with Singapore Airlines. The rest is average to below average with definite cut backs evident. Also disappointed that when I booked this flight it was for the 777 which has better seats for sleep but that changed to the less than comfortable 350-900 medium haul.   Disappointing flight from Singapore to Auckland. A good seat, tasteless food and the worst Illy coffee i have had. What concerned me the most is the cost we paid for these flights, this one one of four flights we took on Singapore airlines over the last three weeks. The Auckland to Singapore flights seemed understaffed, whereas the Singapore to Bangkok flights seemed a lot more organised and a better food selection.    The flight seemed quite full with huge line up at the gate security area. No priority line but thatÆ’??s ok. Boarding was odd with just a gate agent yelling out instructions. The seat was fine but no bottle of water which was disappointing. We used book the cook. My husbands beef cheek was tender but my steak was too tough to cut or even bite into. The crew were lovely but disorganised. The right side of the plane were offered bread after the meal not before. My side missed out entirely. Arriving at Ho Chi Minh city, no priority line for immigration. Never mind. It was a 5/10 flight. Nothing special.   They cancel our flight and push us to an 8h earlier flight, and notify us last minute by calling us internationally about the change. Their customer service put us on hold for more than half of the 25 minute call, something that could have been done online for free, but they found it necessary to call. They even didnt offer food and beverage vouchers to cover the extra 8h on Singapore Airport. Their ground staff was sending us from one side to the other without a solution. After trying to get in touch with them it took 1.5 month to get a reply saying they dont care. Also transfer was unclear as the gates were closed until very close to departure. My inflight food was very bad, and in-flight service almost non-existent. You had to go to the kitchen area to ask for some drinks. In-flight entertainment was good with many recent movies. I will never fly again with Singapore Airlines after this.  What a shame. Delayed baggage when I arrived at the Paris airport. The representative told me that it would be sent the next day. I arrived on Thursday evening and it is now Saturday evening and I have not seen my luggage. Neither received any calls from anyone. I dont know where is my luggage and I am left waiting for it at home. Even low cost airline provide a better customer service support. I have no idea why it is cited as among the best airlines. It is not even Top 20 in my book. Was my first time flying with this airline and it will be the last.   SQ171 DAD-SIN. Terrible flight. Boarding started late and was chaos, with no real explanation about the delay. Upon boarding could not use the overhead above my seat, and was not allowed to have any personal items. There was a Headphone shortage. Took off, and inflight service started rather late. Cabin attendants speaking extremely fast, and I was unable to comprehend what they were saying. Multiple times, Had to ask them to slow down. They ran out of food. Offered Entr??e was disgusting, and I refused. They came back, and tried to offer me the Business Class entr??e, but there was only 1 choice. I passed, but they hounded me with endless questions. Landed, and couldnÆ’??t get access to my luggage. Singapore Airlines is only good on Ultra Long Haul flights. With Asian connections not anymore, since they got rid of the A330.    Im a vegetarian, the food was tasty but I have some thoughts: a bun served with butter without any addition in one of the main meals? I had to ask for a drink because the service  walked by multiple times ignoring me. I flew with them 4 times, two flights of 14.5 hours plus 2 shorter flights on 1 out of 4 flights, I can say that the service was at a high level. The seats were super uncomfortable. The number of drinks served for 14.5 hours is really poor. The last drink I asked for was water, and the staff brought me a tap water.    We flew the SQ 322 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow on Tuesday 2nd august 2022 arriving at London Heathrow at 6am. When we got on the flight the seat part of my daughters seat was missing. She was seated in 54k next to the window. Somebody came and replaced it so she could sit down. We all fell asleep immediately as it was almost 1am in the morning Sydney time. Half way through the flight my daughter realised her socks were wet. We had a look at them and realised they stank of vomit. We then checked all of her toys and our bags that were on the floor and they were all damp and stank of vomit. All of her things, shoes, socks and bottom of her trousers just absolutely stank of vomit and the ground was soaking wet. I can not believe that after such a terrible pandemic my daughter was allowed to sit in an area where someone had so obviously recently been vomiting. Not to mention how disgusting it has been travelling to our hotel in a car with bags all covered in sick and smelling absolutely terrible. I complained to the air steward and asked her to make a note as it was such a disgusting way to have to sit on a long haul flight. Our short UK holiday absolutely ruined, not being able to see my terminally ill father for 8 days in fear of passing it to him, which his immune system could not have handled. This after not seeing him due to the pandemic for 3 years! I understand we flew economy, but at the very least we expected the seats to be clean and sanitary. I emailed the airline through my husbands official Singapore Airlines account, and we heard nothing. I emailed several times, nothing. I only got a response from the airline when I involved a third party resolver government site that helps consumers. They told me nothing had been reported, and that the airline staff deny this even happened. So at the very least they are not logging and recording the changing of seats which must be a safety issue. I find very hard to believe the air steward doesnt remember covering the vomit floor with a blanket and spraying air freshener over it for us. I also asked her to log it all, and she said she would. The airline said all the attendants had been interviewed but they all deny this even happened. Its not so much what happened, it is more the absolute denial that it even took place.   No pillows in economy cabin for a 13hr flight, I was offered an extra blanket to use as a makeshift pillow, hardly comfortable. Meal portions were small, no salad or small starter was offered, no towelette and they dont provide salt and pepper sachets with the meal. WiFi was erratic and terminal 2 is a non event due to renovations ! All in all a highly unsatisfactory experience and we will think twice before flying Singapore Airlines again.   Ruined a trip of a lifetime for myself, wife and family. From cancelling our paid seats, that were booked early, we were then separated on the flight. Some of our baggage was left behind, and a absolutely nightmare trying to sort. Staff on plane and at airports not interested and give the feeling that they did not want to be there.    I flew with Singapore Airlines from London on a 11.30am local time arriving in Singapore 7.30am local time next day. For some unknown reason this airline serves breakfast at 1.45am Singapore time. I and other passengers were woken up so we could have a breakfast. Once breakfast was finished we still had 5 more hours of flying time. How stupid is this. Dreading my flight home. I have travelled with this airline in the past but it now is on a par with a low cost airline. Very disappointed.  Singapore to Sydney. The decline in service and product continues from Singapore Airlines. Premium Economy includes plastic glasses, only two wine choices (Red or White) only one glass was offered per passenger and the food offering economy standard. Neither of the above are consistent with the airlineÆ’??s advertised offer. The were no masks/socks offered. The A380 Premium Economy seats are much poorer design compared to the A350 seat in the same class/airline. Hard vinyl covered seats, impossible to get comfortable in. Booked a window seat but impossible to lean against the window as seat is 200mm from window. Unless you can book for only 10-15 % more than economy I wouldnÆ’??t bother Entertainment is good in its range but the system is unstable. Wifi wouldnÆ’??t connect   Short answer: extremely dated and old aircrafts, unpleasant ambiance, cramped seats and broken seats, closed toilets, subpar food. Good attitude of flight attendants. Long answer. The last time I flew SQ was back in 2006 and do remember that it was a very pleasant flight. Since then mostly have been flying Qatar, Emirates, Turkish and many EU/American airlines. First impression, the ambiance of the aircraft is very unpleasant when comparing it to Emirates or Qatar. IFE is small screen with limited choices. No amenity kit of any sort - zero. There was a blanket and a pillow though. One of the toilet from LA to Singapore was closed with an Out of Order note on it, so basically keep waiting for your turn. Food quality is really terrible compared to Emirates/Qatar. No salad or fruit. During the flight no water service. I am used to sitting on 15 hour Dubai flights but never get such pain as this time on Singapore. It is basically now a budget airline but with a 5 star price tag. Even the business class seats look tired and dated. Wont recommend unless you have no choice.   I recently flew Singapore Airlines Brisbane to Cape Town, only to have them lose my luggage. Despite contacting the Cape Town, Brisbane and Singapore office I have had no contact from anyone, apart from a generic email, dated 6 days ago saying they are attempting to locate my luggage. What should have been a happy experience has been completely ruined not only losing my luggage, but all the gifts I had bought my family who I havenÆ’??t seen in four years.   SQ033 from San Francisco to Singapore in what was sold a premium economy. Apart from slightly larger seat there is nothing to distinguish from regular economy. Very cramped in 2-4-2 seating. No champagne for take-off on 15-hour journey, no amenities, not even hand cream in the bathroom. In addition the entertainment system was bizarre Æ’?? if you arenÆ’??t a fan of Tom Cruise or superheroes you are out of luck. Seriously, there was nothing to watch. Could not comment on the dinner as we chose to eat in the airport. Breakfast was okay for an economy class meal but coffee was not good. I paid a substantial premium for this and I am not impressed.    Queued for Business class check in - only 2 servers. Entertainment very limited, games needs your own device. My meal was very poor. Seats and staff ok. Photo is the 5pm refreshment.   Our first flight was delayed more than one hour, so we lost our connecting flight. The new booking provided was horrible. I was travelling with my four-year-old and the new seat provided is far away, and we were separated. All the family members are separated for the whole journey. Miscommunication between the crew members made us to walk between the terminals for 2 times. Didnt get any help from the crew, even though we requested to provide a seat together.   Order special meals from through their apps. In the flight, I was not served with the chosen special meals, and asked the flight attendant to check. She said that all special meals has been handed out.  I had to write a email via the help section to double confirm whats the reason behind this. I was told via email that special meal was not able to be catered on the said flight due to insufficient preparation time. Truly disappointed with these behavior. There is no inflight entertainment for 2.5 hours flight, and the standard inflight meal is small in portion.    My recent flight from London to Singapore was very disappointing. Granted that the departure and arrival times were very good, and my seat was comfortable. Gone are the warms towels prior to your meal, no menu cards and no water runs through the flight. Then there was the lunch service, the bread roll was more like a brick - when asking the flight attendant if I could have another one he replied that they were all like that. No entree /dessert on  meal tray. Breakfast was served 5 hours prior to landing and my meal was very poor in quantity and quality.   Checkin in Istanbul fast and efficient. Turkish Airlines lounge just amazing; something SQ could learn from looking at its Æ’??upgraded new Krisflyer Lounge in Terminal 3 in Singapore. Boarding in Istanbul was well organized. Seat spacious and comfortable. Food decent, but unfortunately no Book the Cook service ex Istanbul. The big negative point of this flight was the service. Painfully slow, but still hectic and robotic. The lunch service took almost 3 hours. It took an hour from the Satay serving till the appetizer was served. No dining on demand like the ME carrier. Out of the 10.5h flight, almost half of the time was spent with meals. What happened to the previously famous Singapore girl? SQ service does not have the perfection of Qatar, nor the efficiency of LH. Krisflyer lounge in Singapore was so crowded that I left after a while. Shorter flight from Singapore to BKK was uneventful, with a faster service, but still robotic impersonal service.   I flew with Singapore Airlines from Brisbane to Greece recently and they lost my luggage. The suitcase was returned to me at the end of my holidays (3 weeks later) and caused me to have to change holidays plans, lots of frustration trying to reach someone form the company and incurred unexpected expenses as I landed with no personal belongings. Ive sent two separate feedback forms and there has been no reply and when I managed to finally reach someone from their call centre service, they did not know how to help me and put me on hold for half an hour. This is ridiculous customer service for a company which is supposed to be among the best in the world.    Our family flew with Singapore Airlines since long time. We had experienced a wonderful service, especially for kids. We were so disappointed when travelling again this time in July 2022 from Paris to Vietnam via Singapore. Fares were very high but foods were very poor, no more gift for kids, no menu for kids, no snack during long flight. We understand that pandemic may caused difficulty for all airlines, but Singapore Airlines should not cut expenses.   Singapore Airlines no longer the same, my food tray was near empty. I had chicken noodles, thats about it with a bread. Food was no better from Melbourne to Singapore. The rice with chicken packed with rice and 4 pcs of chicken and a bread. Used to have fruits and cakes, what was called sandwich was a soggy curry puff serves right before landing. From Melbourne to Singapore many were not masked. The air stewardess talked to the unmasked passengers and throughout the flight the passenger was mask off.    The boarding and take-off was delayed. The food on board was beef stew, a piece of cake and a cold, rigid bread. It was very difficult to see for the middle row. They were written at a place you cannot see from the aisle, you go to toilet when the light is off and then you cannot find your seat again. They served me drinks twice during an 8-hour flight, I know we can ask for it any time.    Boarding was smooth. No welcome-drinks offered, after request I got one. A narrow business-class seat, where I felt squeezed in, a huge console on the left, which is too high to use as an arm-rest and a divider on the right with reading lights.  Sleeping for me was impossible, because the seat/bed is too narrow.  With the exception of slippers no amenities offered, I was re-assured that amenity-kits are available on request. CaesarÆ’??s Salad came without dressing and croutons were missing, too. The salad was a green salad-leaf, one in 2 parts cut cherry-tomato and two tiny bits of thinnest parmesan cheese. The 2 choices of white wine were disappointing: both Australian wines, 1 Chardonnay and 1 Riesling. My main course, pan seared salmon was dry and overcooked. The vanilla ice-cream was nice, though and the cheese platter was at least a choice of 3, but served with no grapes. No pralines offered. As for my second meal, Tom Yum Vermicelli with prawns. Again, the dish was small but I could get a vanilla-chocolate cake. The inflight program was functioning, but with little to no choices for me. Since no printed reading material was available I wanted to download some business magazines to my laptop, but was informed, that download is possible on smartphones and tablets only.    I was at the airport early and check-in was supposed to open 3 hours before departure but opened 15 minutes late with long queues for both, economy- and business-class already. No warm welcome back  by the leading stewardess. No welcome-drinks, no hot-towel and with the exception of slippers no amenities. For my after take-off drink I opted for a hot sake. Together with satays as canap??s I got a tiny 4cl glass of sake and not the full 180ml bottle. One different guest, however enjoyed the whole bottle by his own Æ’?? another example, that Solitaire-PPS-membership does not pay out anymore. I ordered a Gin&Tonic instead, delivered to me with my own lemons, which I brought from the Lufthansa-lounge. I also brought my own Lufthansa-refreshing-towels, which the crew chilled for me and brought to me after meals and sleeping. The starter (beef pastrami) was tiny but tasty. The chicken roulade with pretzel stuffing was a pretzel roulade with lots of pretzel outside and a tiny piece of chicken inside, dry and almost tasteless. My choice of wine (Australian Shiraz) was disappointing. Ironically, SIA re-introduced a printed menu, even featuring its Æ’??wine connoisseursÆ’?? Æ’?? but the actual wine-list was missing, so I could not verify the exact origin of my wine. The cheese-plate was disappointing consisting of 2 small tiny bits only (before it was at min. 3 choices, being freshly cut) with no grapes, as before. At least the Pumpkin Seed Parfait was nice and I was lucky to get the chocolate cake on request. No pralines. My choice of digestive, the Aberfeldy 16 yearsÆ’?? single malt was not catered for and a Japanese whiskey was offered instead. Why then having a single malt on the menu? As SIA doesnÆ’??t hand out any amenities to its business-class passengers,  I brought my own slippers and amenity-kit from a flight with Austrian earlier. The next disappointment was the economy-class-style breakfast with scrambled eggs or egg-noodles (2 different styles, though) and yoghurt or muesli. The only difference to an economy-class breakfast is, that the dishes are being served one after each other, but the sizes are tiny. I was lucky, there were still the seafood noodle soup from lunch left, so I decided for that. No freshly squeezed orange-juice. Thank you SIA for a good flight-experience before Covid. But now, with all the service and amenity-cuts itÆ’??s time to say goodbye.   My initial flight was booked from Singapore to Darwin in April 2022. They cancelled my flight to Darwin for operational reasons and rebooked me after three days. I had to reach Australia earlier than rebooked date. I called the customer line and explained. They charged me to rebook me to a flight to Sydney as they had no other options available to fly me to Darwin. They did not give me a ticket from Sydney to Darwin and I lost a lot of money. Incompetent customer service staff and SQs attitude to their own cancellation was pathetic. The flight comfort was okay but a big decline in their overall customer care.    I recently flew to/from SFO in Business Class and it was not worth it. On the surface, customer service seemed normal but it was a far cry from the past and not worth the extra money to upgrade from Economy Premium. If you are short like me, sleeping in the cubby hole, in a flat position is fine. Getting the seats up/down is a ridiculous exercise requiring assistance. Not the least bit convenient. It took 4+ hours for the flight staff to get my audio working. Food was some of the worst yet. Trying to get a glass of wine refilled was arduous. Because of all the stories of airline cancellations and delays, I did not risk flying from PDX to SFO with a short layover. Certainly 5 hours was sufficient. Because of the lame check-in policies and process for getting a boarding pass, I was forced to wait 3+ hours for the Singapore counter to open.  The United Lounge at SFO was great. On the flight, it was more of the same, as in the flight to SFO. In addition to the wait for a rest room, no amenities (like socks or travel kit) was offered to me. I will think long and hard before flying their Business Class again.  Check-in was fast, because I could use the business-class check-in counters as a PPS-member. Otherwise endless queues. Boarding was slow because the flight was full and I boarded late with the crowds. No recognition as a Solitaire-PPS-member on board as before. Cabin crew busy with sorting the passengers and their cabin-luggage to not miss our slot. Seat in a 3-3-3 configuration very narrow, seat-pitch ok (for me being 1.7m only) sufficient, however. Left channel of my speakers was not working, even after exchanging them. Internet not working on my phone, either. No help given to connect, as on earlier flights, instead proof was given to me by a flight attendant that Internet was working on her iphone. Not really helpful. No reading materials. Very basic and little food-options offered in a tiny cardboard-box, designed for a reason (whatever this reason may be). Very inattentive inflight-cabin-crew: As for the after dinner drink I was ignored by the them while my two seat-members got served their drinks of choice. Minimum seat-recline, similar to those in budget-airlines. No soap in washroom. No disinfectant-kits offered as advertised, I got one after request only. Wearing a mask, which is mandatory was not re-enforced, a man in the middle seat was wearing his mask under his chin - no one of the crew cared. Overall the crew seemed to be overworked and de-motivated. The typical glass of champagne offered to me as a PPS-member when I raised my concerns did not really help, it just would have been good enough if the cabin-crew would have fulfilled their duties. Disembarking was fast and swift as well as delivery of my checked-in baggage.   The second leg of my trip from Hanoi to San Francisco was on SQ032 on June 16th, and this is the flight I wish to review because my reserved seat was not honored. I was first given a seat which was totally unacceptable and I requested another aisle seat. The second seat was in the exit row directly next to the door (facing the crew jump seats). This new seat had no storage pockets since there was no seat in front, and had both monitor and tray table attached. The toilets were directly behind the crew seats giving me little if any privacy and almost no chance to sleep with the toilet traffic. It is true that this new seat had extra leg room. I was quite miserable in this seat due to the lack of privacy and I had to use the floor for my storage needs. Thank god for the snacks in the rear because the 2 meals served were pretty bad. The flight attendants were most helpful throughout the flight, but I will seriously consider my options when flying this route in the future.   Singapore Airline is an expensive budget airline. The service was very poor, the call center the worst. This flight I had the worst food in business class I had experienced. Service is slow always and wine options are like economy. Wi-if not working for the overall trip.   Prior to flying I had a nightmare trying to rearrange my flight when quarantine rules changed. Emails were not replied to and the UK telephone line required a pin to proceed.  The change I required was not possible online. I purchased an aisle seat but I was not allocated one when they changed my booking. The flight was very disappointing. We took off about 12.30pm. After 1 and a half hours were served a curry and rice, a roll and ice cream. There were only two drinks service during a flight of more than 12 and a half hours. Our second meal, breakfast was served 9.5 hours later. Unfortunately my seat was near the galley and the door to staff quarters and the crew slammed the door nearly every ten minutes and were really inconsiderate I thought. I was quite disgruntled so attempted to get a refund on the seats I had purchased and voice my complaints. Yet again I have found it impossible to contact them.   Singapore Airlines is no longer what it used to be. The call centre is a disgrace and fails miserably in its job. Check-in was chaotic. Inflight service has dropped to dismal levels. There is no welcome drink, no hot towels, no menus given. The meals were one of the worst I have ever had. The eggs were dry and rubbery. I have had far better meals in the economy class on Flydubai which is a budget airline.   Best aircraft in the fleet! I was a little apprehensive flying on the 737 Max8 from Phuket but this turned out to be the jewel in the fleet. A beautiful spacious modern aircraft with unusually good legroom. No need to upgrade for this short flight. The catering let the side down. OK it was a short flight but serving wet noodles in a cardboard carton is not sensible. ItÆ’??s too easy to spill or splash down your shirt, not a good look. There was some turbulence after about 30 minutes and the fasten seatbelt signs came on. Unfortunately, they stayed on for the remainder of the flight even though the turbulence ended after 4-5 minutes barring access to the lavatories. SIN-LHR on an A380. A complete nightmare.  I had an aisle seat with a very large male next to me spilling into my seat space for 13+ hours. This was forcing me into the aisle space where the crew repeatedly knocked into me either rushing down the plane or bashing me with the catering trollies resulting in no sleep. There was never an apology from any of the crew. The food was only just enough with many of the previously supplied items missing. I will never use them again.   First flight on 26th April was a tatty 777-300. The saving grace was no passenger in the middle seat.  The carpet in the aisle was threadbare. The seating upholstery was no better, very scruffy. No fruit, no salad, no cheese & crackers and only one choice for breakfast. A cold roll was served but only butter to put on it, no conserves. No pre meal drink service. One beer or 1 glass of wine served with the meal. No wifi all flight. The in flight entertainment had to be rebooted 5 times. The crew were very good on this leg regularly passing through the cabin with water. SIN - BKK a more modern A350. I was looking forward to my 1st flight on an A350. The seats were thin with little support. Again the only saving grace was no centre seat occupant. The crew seemed to be in training with young people following older crew members around. I purposely selected Singapore Airlines for my flight following their pre-covid reputation at extra expense.   On 25th May I flew on SQ736 to Phuket. A young child was running up and down the aisle, during turbulence, approach and after landing, during taxi to gate. The parents absolutely didnÆ’??t care and the cabin crew didnÆ’??t either.   Very disappointing service from SIA. Plane was dirty departing SIN and staff communication was poor. Staff were curt to the point of thinly veiled rudeness. Lots of room for improvement here.   There were no welcome-drinks offered, no paper-menu available, no newspapers or magazines offered, Slippers, eye-shades and socks on request.  No tooth-brush- or shaving-kits in the washrooms, instead on request an amenity-kit containing a tooth-brush-set and a pair of socks. The quality and quantity of food is lowered significantly, with cold food items covered by plastic. The cheese plate is pre-packed with 2 tiny choices. I was lucky to get as a Solitaire PPS member a second one. There was not even a slice of lemon for a good glass of tea or a simple Gin Tonic available. Wines are  offered based on red or white. Only after request, the bottles are shown. Yet, any description of the taste and the drinking experience is Æ’?? thanks to the no menu. Same for food: no chance to enhancing your appetite by looking at the menu upfront, no chance to check quickly what kind of food you are enjoying right now because you need to open the digital menu Æ’?? which means you have to pause the movie you are watching, search for the meal menu to finally get to the description of dishes - I did not manage to find it. No pralines are offered after the main meal anymore. No Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge available any more. No hot towels to refresh after boarding, after the meal or sleep. Chocolate (e.g. Ferrero Rocher before) on the snack-selection was replaced by cheap no-name cookies, which comes in a see-through plastic-container. The silver-kris-magazine available online only. The internet-connectivity was poor on this flight and did not work for more than 50% of the flight-time.  Significant lower services and amenities for a significantly higher price.   Not recommended if you have food restriction. I requested many days via App and call before my flight SIN to LHR for gluten free and non-beef mean. However my requests were pending for both flights. The crew offered to serve me Pasta with breadÆ’?? instead of gluten free meal. After feeding back to the airlines, thereÆ’??s no response from them.   5 star for flight attendants, always friendly and helpful. The A350 seats are thin and hard. Boarding process was very unorganised.  Quality of my food was terrible. SilverKris lounge at Changi airport was chaotic, impossible to find a seat.   My recent flights with Singapore airlines were some of the worst travel experiences I have had. We have been unable to travel to New Zealand for almost 3 years due to the pandemic. As borders were finally open we booked flights with Singapore Airlines, which were more expensive than any other airline, thinking spending more money would be worth it after such a long wait .. how wrong were we! Our outbound flight, SQ 305 on 17 March 2022 from London to Singapore was delayed by 1 hour and 53 minutes, which led to us being unable to make our connection flight to Auckland, SQ 281 on 18 March 2022. They then had a technical fault also and the flight was further delayed, causing our missed connection time to Auckland. The staff onboard the plane had no idea what was going to happen, and even though most of the aircraft had connections to make, they gave us no information and were incredibly unhelpful. Once we arrived in Singapore, it was an even worse state of affairs. We were greeted by a makeshift desk with everyone scrambling to give out new tickets (there were literally hundreds of people with missed connections). We were told we had missed our flight, and the next connection was 14 hours away. No food vouchers, no hotel rooms offered. We were told all the airport hotels were booked, however we walked to and managed to get a room, at our own cost. The next flight was also packed, and even though my partner and I had paid extra money for seats together, the new plane was unable to accommodate this and we had to sit separately. My partner has food intolerances, and none of his meals was catered for on the next 10-hour-long flight. He was offered some crisps and that was all for the entire flight. We honestly could not believe how bad the whole journey had been and arrived in Auckland completely and utterly exhausted. A really bad start to a trip we had been looking forward to for such a long time. On our return flight, we luckily made our connection. I would say the meals and customer service have gone downhill and it did not feel like we were traveling on a premium airline. Since being home, we have complained to Singapore Airlines and asked for a refund/compensation for our outward flight and the hotel we had to pay for. However, they claim it is not their fault and is refusing any refunds.    The airline refuses to refund my ticket for May 2022. The request to instead rebook my ticket if a refund is not possible was also never replied to. I had contacted the airlines on april 20th via their portal and have not received any answer until now. I had also called their customer service last week and had to wait 1 hour until someone picked up. The person that picked up was not helpful at all, putting me on hold for at least another 20 minutes in total. In the end my request to refund the ticket into credits or money or at least rebook the ticket in the same class for another date was not fulfilled. I was told I could expect another call from a manager in the same week which did not happen.   The check-in process at JFK was the worst check-in experience Ive experienced. I was waiting for check-in for over 2 hours. The line just didnt move at all. The agent was extremely inefficient. I was one of the last customers to check in and it was about 30 minutes before the departure time. The counter agents was escorting a group of last-to-check-in customers to the security checkpoint so they could skip the line (we were late) and somehow I was the only one who left in the security line on my own. The service on board was terrible despite the high-regarded in-flight service that Singapore Airlines is usually known for. The service was so slow for a flight with only 160 customers.  I sat at one of the single seat toward the end of the aircraft and the steward kept bumping into me like I was sitting on the aisle. He didnt even apologize. My food was OK at best. The worst part was probably the lavatories. Truly disgusting, trash was everywhere on the floor.    My wife and I booked a ticket to Manila from London. A few weeks after we booked we received an e-mail that very clearly stated that we could upgrade to Business class and showed a price We jumped at it and booked. We got an email saying we were upgraded on the 2nd leg from Singapore to Manila. I called and was told we were not upgraded on the London Manila leg as Business class was full. I told the CS rep that we did not need Business class for a 3 hour flight and requested a refund, the lady went to ask her supervisor who then told us company policy was no refunds. We went from being a happy customer to a very unhappy one. The food was the same as all other airlines, nothing memorable. The in flight staff were great. We are disabled. Very average service. Much better on our usual carrier, Qatar Airways. We had a bad experience 7 years ago with SQ and swore never to fly them again. I wish we had kept to that decision.    The SQ system can almost never get mileage accrual nor ticket changes right. I have called them 29 times in the last 12 months and the contact number has an average waiting time of just over 1 hour.  I wasted so much time with them on the line. The service has been downgraded so much. Most amenities are gone. My food was of very low quality and Book the chef is mostly not available (even if they claim they are on the website).   I just had the worst experience at Paris CDG Airport. Their baggage weight policies are insane.  I was in Nairobi then Paris coming from NY. Decided to extend through Singapore heading to Hanoi. I have been allowed 50lbs (about 23kgs) by every airline but Singapore Airlines only allow 30 kgs total and they tried to charge me $700 for about 16 extra kgs. I ended up arguing with them and took some stuff out of my and stuck it in my jacket and carry on.    There was no water or juice served for one and half hours which was ridiculous. Food serving was chaotic as crew moving back wards and forwards in a disorganised fashion. We ordered Hindu non veg meal and ordered meal were missing from the cabin crew list. Quantity of my food was horrific. Service was all over the place and chaotic. When I questioned they said there are 30 kids travelling on a full flight.    The aircraft and the crew are so nice. People are helpful and very kind. But the customer service is honestly the worst Ive ever seen. Impossible to change my booking online. I was in Thailand impossible to contact them. They do not answer mails or phone. I would never fly again with them.   A350 from Melbourne to Singapore was in regional configuration and unsuitable for a nearly 8 hour flight. My seat was hard and there are too many in the business class section. Food served to me was in microscopic proportions and there was no drink on boarding. I waited 90 mins for first refreshment. A380 upper deck has many business class seats, some of the windows are obscured, my seat was rock hard though it was bigger and with more storage than previous flight. Long delay to my getting refreshments. Long delay to serving food. I got the impression that there are too many business class seats on the A380 for good service to be possible. In transit at Changi the Krisflyer lounge was packed with nowhere to sit and overheated.   Singapore to Male, no inflight entertainment or even music. No towels, no appetiser and no choice of meal. Coffee/tea was not offered to me. After takeoff 1 toilet was locked for the entire flight until before landing. That usable toilet was filthy after an hour. When booking this route there are 2 flights a day both the same price but the night flight is operated by the A350 which has inflight entertainment. The day flight i took did not. Why the difference when the ticket price is the same? The website should prompt the user that this flight has no entertainment. No smiles no friendliness. Whatever happened to the Singapore Girl and A Great Way To Fly?   The check in was excellent given the fact it was during the pandemic. Took off on time. The movies need to be updated more frequently. My food was a let down and portions are very small. From Singapore to Sydney ( 8+ hours) we were given one meal which included a rice noodles with seafood, ice cream and a bread roll. No salad or cheese and crackers. No pre arrival meal was given. No hot towels on both flights and my wifi never worked. However the staff were very polite and courteous.    I booked to go to Thailand on the 16/12/21 From Manchester but my wife had a positive covid test so we couldnt fly. I have been trying to get in touch with Singapore Airlines but I am just being ignored. Tried phoning the help line but gave up after 1 3/4 hours. I booked directly with the airline in case something like this happened but it hasnt made any difference.   We flew coach class from SFO to Bangkok in November 2021. We found that Singapore Airlines was not the airline of old. It used to be the best airline in Asia. No more. The seating was cramped, not on par with other competitor airlines such as ANA, and certainly no better than EVA or Cathay Pacific. They canceled our connecting flight on their subsidiary airline, Scoot, booked through Singapore Air, from Phuket to Singapore on the return leg. We were notified by email just 16 days before the scheduled flight. We were informed that we had to now fly out of Bangkok to Singapore, not Phuket, and we had to re-book through Singapore Air, not Scoot, and had to telephone a customer service agent to do so. This meant a total revision of our itinerary and losing the non-refundable tickets we had already purchased for flights in Thailand. We spent a total of 4 hours on hold attempting, without success, to reach an agent. We called both the Bangkok and Singapore offices to no avail. We even had a travel agent call for us on the agents line. She gave up after 1/2 hour on hold. We tried email. They told us they would get back to us in 7-14 days. We had gone to both the Phuket and Bangkok airport Singapore Air offices but both were closed. We gave up and flew ANA home. They answer their phones. When we returned we found that all they would refund were the taxes. Sent a letter by post to the corporate headquarters. One month later no response, not even an acknowledgment of receipt.   Trying to contact them by the call center is a nightmare with a lack of customer service and inefficient. The seats on this aircraft were the new regional business class seats which are not bad. The IFE is also good and we had 100MB free wifi which was nice. The crew were good. However, the food was an utter disaster. For a 7 hour flight, we were given 1 miserable meal which was rubbery eggs and mashed-up vegetables. Book the cook was not functioning on this sector so we had no other choice. No welcome drink either. Standards have gone down drastically from many aspects.   The boarding went on very smooth. The seat was very comfortable and had enough legroom. I was really disappointed with the meals. I chose the lemon chicken with fried rice. It was a very small portion. No salad was offered. The bread roll was in plastic packet cold and dry. The chocolate cake for dessert was okay. Usually flights between the east coast of Australia and Asia they offer a main meal and a pre arrival meal but on this trip no pre arrival meal was given. I feel like SQ is trying to save money by doing this. The IFE was good. Overall I wont be flying with them in the future.    We booked return flights from London to Singapore with a guarantee of unlimited complimentary changes. Due to COVID we could not travel in Nov 2021 and want to move the flight to Oct 2022. Online, it is impossible to move the flight to any date later than 12 months from the date that the booking was made. Calling Customer Service is tortuous! My partner has made three calls. Each time she has waited approximately two hours to speak to an agent. Each time she has been told that they have to make the change manually but then when the agent tries to action the change, they are unable to do so, refer to a manager and then promise to call back. They dont call back. This is totally unacceptable! On the latest call, my partner asked to speak to somebody more senior than the agent she had been speaking to. In the process of transferring the call, she was cut off. Nobody has called back.  My partner is not so stressed and upset about this matter that I have taken over dealing with the airline. We dont have time to waste on the phone trying to resolve this.  A five-star airline needs to treat its customers with respect from the day of booking until the end of the flight. Its not all about the flight and service (or lack of it) prior to the day of travel needs to form part of an airlines overall score. Singapore Airlines are not worthy of your award at the moment.   The flight was booked at a time when the Covid situation was still looking better and the chance to be be able to leave Changi airport during a long layover looked good. That face with Singapore Airlines flexibility claim of change of flights on their website, made me booking a flight with a 16h layover. Unfortunately, things were not looking good about a month ago, and I tried to change my flights to a short layover. I tried to contact SQ via its change of flight form for Covid related reasons through their website. 5 requests over the span of a month remain unanswered till today, complaint emails were also not replied to. I also tried to contact SQ through their callcenter, was placed in a loop for hours. After getting through after days of trying, I was told that there were seats available for the same booking class and I would be informed once the the ticket would be re-issued. So far so good. An hour later I was called, saying that this Æ’??special fare ticket can only be changed if if I pay this and that in addition, which ended up to a ridiculous amount, and I declined. So I was back to square and had to endure a 16h stay at Changi airport. SQ does not honor their claim of ticket flexibility. Other carrier I flew during the pandemic were willing honor their flexibility claims. The flights themselves were rather unremarkable, not as polished as Qatar, with no dining on demand offered. Food was average to say the least. No touchscreen TV and average seat on the really noisy 777ER on the long flight. Overall due to the non existing customer service on the ground, not recommended   I fear for the future of airline travel when airlines appear to use the excuse of covid19 to reduce both the level and quality of service, especially for an airline previously renowned for its 1st class operation like Singapore Airlines. I was bitterly disappointed in my recent flying experience with them; from poor quality food to reduced service levels. The crew was still wonderful, but that cant make up for the overall feeling I was left with. Forget your business class comfort pack (in my view, covid19 is not a reasonable excuse for why this has been dropped), you now need to take your own eye patches/earplugs to be able to sleep if you are prone to light/sound. Instead, youll receive a covid19 kit so you can clean your own cabin area. Meals were of such poor quality that I wished I had brought my own sandwiches. No menus are available so you have to try and listen to rather badly-pronounced meal choices to make your selection. I chose chicken and rice which turned out to be bland and gristly, with practically uncooked chicken skin (see photos). Apparently, the different meal choice of the passenger to my left did not go down well as they also left theirs untouched. My breakfast choice; scrambled eggs and sausage were served practically cold. Excessive amounts of plastic being used in meal preparation is also very disappointing in a world trying on the whole to reduce plastic. This is hands-down the worst experience in business class that I have ever experienced and was compounded by the overly-officious ground staff yelling at us (in hazmat-like suits) to walk in single file as we were marched to a holding area rather than a business class lounge. In this holding area, not even water was on offer. Other lines of passengers transiting on different flights were ordered to stand against the wall whilst our group passed by. My very strong advice, whilst covid19 continues to plague travel, is dont transit through Singapore or use Singapore Airlines.    I booked a round-trip ticket on Singapore Airlines. The company touted customers ability to change their flights for free, even being able to change a flight for free and having one free change after September 30, which would allow them to delay their flight well into 2022. I was able to easily change the flight until mid-September. After that point, I wasnt allowed to change it online and needed to call in which required over 1 hour of waiting. In September I could have changed my return flight to far into the future. In fact, the return leg of my flight was 2 months and 1 day after the initial flight. When I called in to push my flight date back, the customer service agent said I must upgrade my flight to rebook and that there was a minimum required stay of 2 months, meaning I couldnt have a the return leg of the flight more than two months after the initial one. First of all, my return flight was already more than 2 months later and before they restricted online flight changes, I could have changed my flight to much later dates.  The agent also told me the flight change would cost over 900 USD, more than the original round-trip ticket. I requested to speak to a manager. She denied my request and said she would talk to her team. After 30 minutes of being on hold, she said I could book my flight a maximum of one month past the current return date. This was not part of the agreement when I originally booked the flight. Now, however, I didnt need to upgrade the flight for some reason, but the change would cost 490 USD. Booking a one-way ticket at that time cost 497 USD. The agent explained that the difference was in the price of the flight. Nothing she said made sense.  I am about as likely to trust Singapore Airlines again as I am to fly with them.   Ive never had a more frustrating experience trying to book a flight .. website saying unable to proceed, customer service tell me to keep trying different flights until one works. Then several credit cards declined. Customer service tell me to send an email, they say theyll call me back .. never do. Absolute frustrating mess!   Inflating fares to rip off passengers during covid. My flight for December 2020 has been cancelled but SIA are offering a voucher for the fare already paid plus ?Å“40 to be used to make a new reservation costing anything from ?Å“300 - ?Å“1,00 extra on top of what IÆ’??d already paid. IÆ’??m really surprised Singapore Airlines are profiteering from loyal passengers in this way. Surely as one of the leading airlines in the world they should be offering to reschedule flights when there is availability but at no additional fare difference cost. I enjoy the service they provide but I donÆ’??t like being taken advantage of / ripped off and I will remember this smoke & mirrors con trick the next time I book a flight.   Disappointed with Singapore Airlines. Melbourne to Singapore flight was good. There were many passengers in the plane but at least we were one seat apart. Some even had the whole row just for themselves which gave them more space from others. But the transit flight, Singapore to Manila, was unacceptable, it was jam packed and most of us were given seats alongside others whom we did not know. In a 3-seat row, they made us occupy all 3 seats hence, social distancing protocol was not followed when they should have been more careful. We asked the flight attendant he told us we were wearing a face mask and face shield so it should be okay. Please note that ratings below are only based on our flight from Singapore.   Because the travel office where I bought the ticket turned insolvent, Singapore Airlines declared all issued tickets of them as invalid. This is why I had to buy a new and very expensive ticket at Changi Airport directly by Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines however did not inform me about the cancellation of the plane ticket, nor did the check-in hotline inform me about the current situation. I am more than dissatisfied because they decline any responsibility and the information provided by the complaints office does not answer the questions at all.   Sao Paulo to Dublin via Munich on Lufthansa booked with Singapore Airlines redemption miles. A refund was agreed upon 3 months ago. The airline is ignoring requests for a date when the tax refund will be paid.    In light of the lockdown in many countries in March including my own (UK) which sparked a lot of flight cancellations, I decided to request a cash refund from Singapore Airlines via my travel agent and then through them direct from the start of April. For the initial weeks they were telling me that a cash refund could not be offered and I could only re-book or be offered credit towards booking another flight. After three weeks they then decided to officially cancel my flight (due to take off in early May) and agreed to process a refund. It has now been three months since I initially requested a cash refund via my travel agent and there appears to have been no movement from the airline.  I have received time dated copies from my travel agent getting in contact with Singapore Airlines in early April and they have received no communication from the airline has been received thus far despite me being told by an advisor at the airline confirming that they had been in touch with the travel agent to issue the refund, this was around a month ago.    15th March I was meant to fly back to Sydney from Amsterdam. I was visiting family and friends and with COVID-19 I found it hard to leave. I was checked in but later that day read on the Singapore website that you werent allowed to enter Singapore airport if youve been to Germany in the last 14 days. I did. I went through Germany for wintersport to Austria just beforey, so I cancelled my flight. I received 83 euros back (which hardly covers my flight) and I didnt have a choice of accepting that money or not. I just got it back. I tried to contact the airline many times about the situation and never got a reply. Now theyre saying they cant help me because I already received 83 euro back for my cancellation. Whereas I know and shouldve had the right to receive flight credits instead for a flight back to Sydney.    Despicable handling of ticket refunds/flight credits. Purchased ticket through Ctrip in early March for an April departure. Conditions then were: free changes to itinerary. Itinerary was subsequently re-ticketed on Mar 16 due to evolving situation. Departure postponed to May. Now they want to give neither a refund nor flight credits, available to customers who had booked prior to Mar 15, because my ticket was re-issued literally minutes after 0000 hrs, 16 March. I am told again and again to wait. As for what, I am not sure. In the meantime, the route has been canceled for the month of May and Ctrip has not contacted me about my itin.   Osaka to Bangkok via Singapore booked for March 20th. Singapore Airlines does not give you full refunds or vouchers should they decide. In my case they stated that they have adopted a new travel restriction earlier than the Thailand government required and, thus, would have to seek some other transport. Today 03.04 they also confirmed a hefty cancellation/no-show fee would be deduced.    Melbourne to Koh Samui via Singapore. Our flights home were cancelled via email a week ago. Supposed to be flying home today. Email stated that we could get in touch via online form, which has taken days and hours to get to actually work. Email response said that they would get in touch shortly, so far nothing. Wont give refund so that we can source other options, only credit for future flights. Unreachable via phone. Cant log on to site at all now. Phone number states not in service. I understand they must be overwhelmed with queries, but feeling totally abandoned and just want a refund so I can find another way home.   My flight was canceled by Singapore Airlines due to Corona Virus. No transit in SIN possible anymore. They simply cancelled my flights and gave no helping hand to re-book etc. I am booked in Business Class. No refund was granted, only to keep the ticket open for one year. They informed me that if I re-booked to a later flight, a fare difference might appear and I would have to pay on top. This is unbelievable. First they deny any refund, which all other airlines grant, now I also have to pay on top if I re-book to another date. As a frequent traveler and Gold Card Member of Star Alliance, I never expected such behavior from SQ. I strongly suggest not to tolerate such a customer unfriendly style. For me and my company, SQ is not anymore in the traveling list. We will prefer LH/TG going to Europe, and to the US. I am very sorry to write these lines, but other fellow travelers should be aware. By the way the way to get an answer from SQ might take 15-20 days.   Zurich to Melbourne via Singapore booked ages ago. Now with all the travel bans/restrictions due to Corona virus I needed to cancel the three tickets we booked. I cannot reach a ticketing agent on the phone, answering machine tells you to ring again. and again, again to no avail. The ticketing office in Zurich has been shut for a week with a leaflet on the door telling you, you guessed it the number where no-one is home.  I sent an online form to which I got an email telling me that they will respond after 7 working days, that means they will get back to me after my scheduled flight would have taken place.   Adelaide to Singapore. I had two flights booked to and from from Singapore. Because of the epidemic, my conference in February was cancelled in Singapore. My colleague who booked through Qantas got her flight refunded - no questions asked. Singapore Airlines have been difficult to contact and unhelpful. They have not allowed refund. Never flying this airline ever again.   Singapore to Bangkok. Seat and plane were pretty new. Seat was comfortable. Food was terrible. Crew was friendly. Lots better than their economy class crews. Overall was okay.   Los Angeles to Singapore. This is my 3rd time for Singapore and this is my first time for business class. Seat when adjusted to be flat bed was not comfortable as I expected. Food was not okay.   Flew with this airline because of itÆ’??s reputation, but felt very disappointed. The seats felt crammed in and narrow aisles, it was very hot on the flight and my food was disgusting.   Los Angeles to Colombo via Singapore business class. Left on Jan 27 2020 from LAX and returned Feb 21 2020. At their website we were told one can pre-book meals called book the cook which was a joke, no none of the cabin crew knew anything about it. We were given a very generic meal which was nothing to rave about. I complained to the crew and they promised I would have my choice on the return flight - that did not happen either. Their website also bragged about free wifi at cruising altitude, I was able to connect for 10 mins ,after which there was no way to connect for free. Same thing happened when I logged -in under my wifes name - the cabin crew was helpless and could not help. I was told to pay to get wifi , which of-course I did not. The cabin crew were fantastic and did their best to make us feel happy but there was only so much they could do. I travelled frequently on Singapore airline about 10 yrs ago and then I switched to another airline through Hong Kong , regrettably I could not book with them due to the Corona scare in China. My seat on the A350 could not be reclined 180 degrees and my feet hit the front seat and I had to curve my body to fit the space. There was a bed of course -the flight attendant had to lower the vertical back section and fold it down to make a bed, but the hardness and the need to curve the spine made it hard to sleep on this 18 hrs from LAX and 15hrs to LAX. Sorry Singapore airlines you are no longer the top dog in the business. I will think twice before going with you again.   Melbourne to Singapore. The check in experience is the worst. I request for aisle seat and I got the window seat. I cancel my Russia Holiday with Singapore Airlines they refused give me refund.   Los Angeles to Tokyo. Poor food quality (Chef stuff pre-ordered-cold multiple times), aging aircraft interior, insincere flight attendants. Quirky check in (weighing a backpack?). Blow par flight info management (ticketing and gate notification).    Copenhagen to Denpasar via Singapore. I had looked forward to where I could go with the new Airbus 350 and Singapore Airlines with their excellent quality reputation. However, the entertainment consisted of very few new movies. A menu card was handed out, I ordered chicken with Thai curry. The meat was full of cartilage and the rice was dried up. This was accompanied by a cold soft sugar tasting roll.  Singapore Airline offer maybe the cheapest red wine I have tasted. Fortunately they offered Tiger beer. Although the crew carried sparkling wine on the wagon, you had not right to this since it was not in the menu card I was told. Very strange.  On the return flight to Copenhagen the entertainment was slightly better but the food and beverage was far below the standard you get elsewhere like Qatar Airlines. The experience with Singapore Airlines was the biggest disappointment I have had since very long.    Upon attempting to return to Australia Singapore Airlines said I could not check in because my ticket was marked as flown by the ticketing airline. I had to buy another ticket with another airline to fly home. I asked for a letter showing I was not allowed to check in - nothing to do with my behaviour, condition etc. Singapore Airlines wrote to me to say I was a no show not that there was any problem checking-in.    Bangkok to Singapore was the biggest let down. Okay food but they ran out of certain dishes during the first service run. Service on this flight was understandably rushed due to its 2-hours duration. But it was also terrible. I ordered post-meal drink and notes were taken but they forgot about me. I requested the drink again, but was told too late the bar is closed. We pay premium for business class partly to enjoy the amenities including F&B. Running out of certain dishes and forgetting to serve a drink renders this as a wasted expense and for that we currently do not recommend this airline.    Singapore to Perth. The flight was delayed and when we reached the gate was closed and we were advised that the gate is changed. We had to walk to the other side of the airport and sat there for an hour. When we were boarding we were advised that this is a different flight number (same airline and destination though). We were checked in 2 hours prior to the flight time but were never paged us or looked for us. Just took the luggage out of the flight. They advised us that the next flight is full also and we will need to wait till the next day for another flight as well as having to pay penalty.   Singapore to Moscow.  When we are about to land, a passenger went into toilet, the Male Flight attendant asked him before he went in can you hold ? The passenger shook his head &Æ’??went in, subsequently the flight attendant talk to us (all the passengers), this kind of people caused landing to delay. After a while the flight attendant went on to knock on the toilet door & shouted to ask the passenger to come out quickly. Moscow - Singapore 2 Jan 2020. The  question is that does SIA inform their passengers how much alcohol they can consume ? I heard a female flight attendant said he has drank a lot in Mandarin to another flight attendant. Later the customers in front of me request for drinks & I heard the flight attendant said this is a plane not a bar, this is very rude to a customer even you mean well to control consumption of alcohol. SIA has to make a decision, either no alcohol, limited alcohol (informed passengers before booking of tickets) or free flow, find a way to handle it instead of being rude to  passengers.    Melbourne to Chitose return via Singapore with SIA but the Chitose to Singapore leg was codeshare with Scoot and I was appalled that I for the SIA ticket price I paid, I just received budget airline service. Firstly, I had a party of 4 and they couldnt seat us together. They put us as 2, 1, 1. Then after complaining, they put us as 2, 2. But when I flew off, 3 seats were free right next to us! Secondly, they dont give you a choice of meal. Not to mention the food was barely edible. And they only give a bottle of water. I had to pay for beer or soft drink etc. Given I paid SIA prices which is for full service, youd think Id get more service than that.   Melbourne to Coimbatore via Singapore. Singapore Airlines has disappointed us in the last three trips. The price they charge is so expensive but from Singapore to our destination we get to travel in budget airlines which is Scoot or silk air. It doesnÆ’??t make sense at all. When we ask for help they say itÆ’??s a different management so we canÆ’??t help you further. Moreover there is no special assistance in those low cost airlines. Also the Singapore airport was so warm and the air conditioner was not controlled well across.   Bangkok to Singapore. A mechanical problem with the plane after shifting our gate to a half hour walk away from the original. They go into total chaos, total ineptness. No other plane available. They do not shift passengers onto their other flight, another plane, or other airlines. Four hours later, they send a new plane from Singapore. So six hours delay. The hand writing up of food vouchers for the layover was also quite humorous for 200 passengers. Very poor communication at all times, not even answering direct simple questions.  With the checkin process, more than 12 hours living in the airport.   I have flown SQ a few times before, but find that the current A350 economy class seats are very uncomfortable, at least for a 6 person like me. BLR-SIN was a short haul flight which was even more tightly packed, SIN-MEL was marginally better. MEL-SIN was an older B777, which was far better than the new gen 350s in terms of economy class seats. I had booked SFML, but in every flight ended up getting a piece of tasteless, overcooked fish just dabbed with some tomato sauce - a big difference from my previous experience with seafood meal a few years ago. I do not think I will go for this option any more on Singapore Airlines. The flights were on time, the crew helpful, but overall my experience was far from being positive.   I have to admit to a huge disappointment on flying economy class with this airline. The outward trip on the A380 was extremely comfortable, flight attendants good but food was awful, something I wasnÆ’??t expecting having read about the excellent quality of their meals. My main grumble was the return flight on a 777, I have to say that the seat pitches couldnÆ’??t possibly have been the 32 advertised on Skytrax. I am 6ft tall and my knees were touching the seat in front and reclining made little difference as the person in front was fully reclined. I can fully understand how a sardine must feel! The food on this flight was awful, totally lacking in taste. Now I know that some people reading this review will say that if I want more room then fly premium economy or business class, something I would love to do if it was affordable! All in all, flight attendants were wonderful, food was awful and the 777 was diabolical. Sorry Singapore Airlines I wonÆ’??t be flying with you again other than on a A380.   Singapore to Dubai. I was disappointed with the option of foods during flights. We were asked by the FA to choose between chicken sandwich and Hamus with flat bread so I chose the chicken sandwich since I am not a fan of Hamus but it wasnÆ’??t available anymore so the FA insisted if I could have the Hamus instead. I just had a cup of coffee. And also I have also asked for water twice during that flight but nothing was given to me. It made me think that they gave only minimal attention to economy passengers.    Melbourne to Singapore. First I flew in SQ and experience the lounges in both Sydney and Melbourne this month. I must say its the worst experience I have ever had. Running out of food, decor bland and functional (barely) at best, staff sombre and angry. It is tragic for SQ to sell itself as a premium airline with such tired conditions. All in all disappointing experience on SQ   Sydney to Trivandrum via Singapore. I booked this flight under SIA and was not expecting they would code share a full service fare ticket with low cost carrier Scoot on SIN -TRV sector. SIA is charging the same amount in fare as compared to previous years while they code shared with Silk Air which is a full service airline. There was no option for basic seat selection and was served instant fried rice topped with meat and peas. They served a bottle of water and no option for tea/coffee or soft drinks. Silk Air served beer and spirits . I understand why SIA is resorting to this sort of behaviour at the expense of passenger comfort, profits and making use of the monopoly they enjoy on this route. Shameful for an airline which advertises itself as Great Way to Fly. SIA should make amends to passengers who were made to fly on Scoot SIA - TRV route.   Colombo to Sydney via Singapore. I thought I loved Singapore airlines and it seemed okay (not great) when I flew from Sydney to Colombo. But then I had the rudest experience when I travelled back to Australia. The air hostess in my cabin were pretty rude. Its like they just want to get their job done and they dont care about the people. Ive travelled a lot on different airlines and Ive never been treated so rudely.  They barely offer water to people.  I wanted the chicken as i do not eat beef and they wanted me to have the beef and when i said i cant. They took a long time (everyone else had finished eating) to find me some fish meal that wasnt on the menu.  I was grateful. However, that nice gesture didnt last for long. I literally opened my food to eat and the air hostess just dumps an ice cream (magnum) on my tray. Everyone else was happy to get theirs, but I had only begun (not even) eating! I had to gobble my food and eat the melting ice cream!  And on this very flight the air hostess serving me just took the cup in which there was apple juice remaining and poured me water. I also asked them for water when leaving the aircraft and they hesitated and made me stay the whole time until everyone left to get me the water (which was also a very small cup).  On a good note, I must say the flight is comfortable and good. And the food is acceptably good. Id ask everyone who loves staying hydrated on flights to make sure they fill up their own water bottles.   Dhaka to Sydney via Singapore. My seat was in block 5 (seat no 61G and that of my wife was in Black 4 (seat no 46D). We must give heartfelt thanks to the lady who issued these two boarding pass. We must congratulate her as she was kind enough to issue boarding pass in two compartments though there were enough opportunity to issue boarding pass in one compartment and side by side. The performance of that staff I should say most unprofessional and unskill. I found the staff engaged to support wheel chair in Changi airport behaved unprofessional.   Jakarta to Bangalore via Singapore. Their own staff suggested me to change flight which I agreed. But in the new flight, they did not provide the vegetarian food I had ordered in advance. I did not expect them to provide the same variant I ordered. I was told that they will provide any other vegetarian option. The cabin crew refused to make any adjustments. Zero empathy and rude behaviour of the cabin crew makes it worthless to fly this airlines again. Cramped seats in the aircraft A350-900 in economy seats keeps reminding you that you are in cattle class.  London to Singapore. Check in area was chaotic to say the least and I had to label my own baggage prior to drop off. The Kris Lounge is a shared lounge and it was bursting at the seems, basically no seating, therefore had to go to local coffee shop. The service onboard was not what I expected from a 5 Star airline like Singapore Airlines. I would put the service down to being pretty poor and with an old aircraft to match. The only really good thing I can say was that the Wi-Fi was good. I expected much more from Singapore Airlines considering they are 5 Star and have recently won the coveted Skytrax Award for best airline.  Singapore to Perth. SQ is getting more disappointing over time. This is my 2nd flight in a week that is delayed by an hour (my last was late by 90 minutes). SQ used to be reliable and comfortable. In todayÆ’??s delay of 55 minutes, nobody bothered to walk around to give anyone water or juice. After take off, pre-dinner drinks service no longer comes with the trolley. Passengers have a choice of water, juice or beer from the tray. When did SQ downgrade itÆ’??s drink service to European standards? Cabin service overall was good. Food is average. However, the cost cutting measures of SQ is highly visible. I still have a few more business class flights booked till the end of the year but with such bad reliability in schedule, I am switching after this year. Booking an emergency exit seat still meant huge discomfort in a seat far too narrow and poor padding meaning back ache in 90 minute flight. The seats on this aircraft are dreadful. The headphones and sound on the entertainment system was dreadful.   Singapore to Melbourne. I have taken SQ many times and each time is a little worse than the flight before. This flight was on time and passengers were boarded according to section. I was lucky that there was a spare seat between myself and the guy with the aisle seat. Once we took off, the passenger in front reclined (day flight) and it sure makes economy feel so squeezy. Unlike their promise on the website that you wonÆ’??t be packed like sardines, you are. I canÆ’??t eat fish but I guess SQ decided to save money by incorporating all allergies. My breakfast was gluten free (revolting hard dry roll), no dairy and no sugar. I was appalled by it compared to the normal breakfast. I am glad I brought snacks like chocolate and cookies. The selection of entertainment was fine and the toilets are kept clean. However paying so much more to go with SQ I expected the standards to be maintained not reduced. I think I will only base future travel on price as this so called great airline is not so great.   Jakarta to Singapore. I asked for a Vegetarian meal, but they gave us seafood instead. The fish is covered by pasta so we didnÆ’??t notice until my wife took a bite. Complain to one of the flight attendants, they said sorry, which to me isnÆ’??t enough. This is the 2nd time happens to me, not happy. ShouldnÆ’??t trust SQ that much.   Singapore to Delhi. After having the experienced the most arrogant crew ever on an SQ Business Class I have chosen Star Alliance Alternatives such as Asiana and ANA for my recent flights and I have not been disappointed at all, but for my flight to India, there was not viable option, so I went back to SQ and was disappointed again. They are dropping standards. The 2 passengers besides me had to suffer dropping water from the overhead cabinets without any solution, my food was lousy, I found the legroom below the standard of above mentioned airlines. The booking procedure is like a low cost where they are charging up to 10% of the total ticket price for a front row seat. All this from an airlines which was by all means the Best Airline in my flight experience, just a few years back.   Melbourne to Singapore. Cabin crew refused to ask passenger in front of me to pull the chair backup when he served meals. I found it very unprofessional. I asked to speak to his supervisor, he then gave in to ask the front seat passenger to pull his chair up for me to have my meal. No more Singapore Airlines. I got the connected flight from Singapore to Nepal on SilkAir and to my surprise, before even handed my meal, the cabin crew asked the front seat passenger to pull up his chair for me to have my meal. I am not special, they have done that to everyone passenger.  Colombo to Bali via Singapore. Extremely disappointed by the service provided by each cabin crew members of each flight, very arrogant and rude to passengers, basically they didnÆ’??t care about the requests made by myself and by other members who flew with me. Our expectations were very high on this airline, but itÆ’??s not worth the money we spent on, seriously will not recommend or fly on this airline hereafter.  Singapore to Jakarta with Singapore Airlines. Disappointing aircraft. The crews are fine. But not necessarily showing great service. Further the mobile apps of the airline was down and most of the time I couldnÆ’??t check in online. Bad experience overall. Expensively priced which makes it a very overpriced disappointing experience.   . Seoul to Kochi via Singapore. My flight from Kochi to Singapore on SilkAir was very good with enough leg space and tv, food option was just satisfactory, but I appreciate the before flight food pack they gave. Singapore to Seoul was okay, almost on par with Kochi to Singapore but bigger flight (I found silk air have better leg space than Singapore airlines. But return was very disappointing. Seoul to Singapore things except food was on par, but cabin crew was rushing, they gave me less than 2 min to use wet wipes and was eager to collect it back even before I used. Singapore to India worst service, even before they start they were left with veg food and non veg food they asked me but I didnt get it, though my seat was in 1st 15 seats. Toilet just a pair of toilet at back and front toilet though free reserved for business class seats, they didnt let me use it as economy class passenger. There was no TV on return flight and used mobile app to view their movies, limited food option and lack of consistency in service makes me not go on this airline unless to a route that has Singapore as destination for good service and flights are generally scheduled for it Air Asia though less options has better food choices or at least 1-2 very good choices to buy. Advantages  Flight Date change possible for very low fee, which I did. Luggage 30kg very useful. Very quick service Definitely gives 6-10 rating no comparison to other top airlines.    Singapore to London. Incredibly inept Admin. I spent time establishing parameters for which my elderly mother could get a seat close to the lavatory and after many calls direct to Singapore I had confirmation that the range of seats we would get was limited but acceptable. I got this in an email. At boarding, it became clear the layout for our flight was vastly different to that which had been shown previously. She was as far from the lavatory as she could be. Other passengers could not pass us in the aisle and the journey to the lavatory took 10 minutes with the turbulence we encountered. No aisle seats was available in Business class despite a prior agreement that one would be aboard. I may as well have not bothered dealing with the airline. That SIA failed to deliver on this flight and the ensuing return later, shows the customer what the airline think of even their Business Class passengers - absolutely nothing. There is little their superb in-flight service did to improve the bitter resentment on my part. I expected much better after the initial discussions, I got contempt.   We have flown multiple times via Singapore airlines and on each occasion we have had an issue of some kind usually related to seats and Singapore ground staff. Despite complaints directly to the airline I always feel I am wasting my time so I might as well go public with a review. The cabin is nearly always nice and the service is generally good although I have previously been left unable to eat as the only food left has been noodles with prawns and I have an allergy to prawns. On this occasion however we booked our tickets in business class and now that we attempt to select seats we are told we are unable to select the seat. The options are single seats spread around the cabin with no option to sit close to each other over a 12+ hour flight - that said we are still unable to book. We booked the tickets 10 months ago and I refuse to accept we were the last people to book this flight. We have contacted customer services to receive the answer seats are subject to availability. While I can accept that there are limitations on seating we are in advance of online check-in and were just checking available seats of which there are half a dozen dotted around the cabin. To be effectively told tough luck for a $5000 seat is just not acceptable. Unless you are flying alone I would not recommend Singapore airlines. They are totally inflexible in everything they do and do not have any understanding of passenger needs.   Singapore to Delhi. This was our return journey on SQ406 (SIN-DEL) after we arrived in singapore 10 days before with them on SQ401 (which was definitely very good) Things took a U-turn here. The crew onboard was RUDE to the core. No courtsey, Zero on management. We were assigned seats at the end of the plane for 5 people. At the time of serving food, they served the entire plane before us, rows ahead of us and rows behind us, but did not offer us any food. after 2 hours of takeoff, with the entire plane almost dozed off after their meals, they came to us only to inform, they have no food available. Only 1 tray, that too with Fish. We were with a kid, hungry. Had we have known this, we would have had our own meal at the airport. On confronting them, they could only apologize. But somehow managed to get a veg tray from somewhere and we fed the little one. The entire journey we got nothing to eat! We travelled without meals.   6 hours journey. They had no remorse. Called them to serve water, they did not bother to serve it.  It was a nightmare of a flight. 4 of us were hungry throughout and were waiting for this nightmare to end as soon as possible. We could have done online checkin and booked our meals beforehand, but with the child, this is not possible to do so online and we had to do a manual checkin. Was this our fault? I dont think so.  Singapore to Canberra via Sydney. I have flown many times with economy airlines such as Jetstar and AirAsia. But my first ever flights with Singapore Airlines which I had high hopes for were a washout. The economy seats are much smaller than AirAsia and all you are getting for your extra dollars is a menu and entertainment options. Also I have an injury and asked for help getting on and off the plane before the crush. They made me get a medical certificate to prove the injury but let me on with every one else. And with a broken foot those small seats were even worse. I will return to AirAsia for future flights.   Singapore to Surabaya. I always fly Singapore airlines for work, and it has been getting worse by the day. The flight is perpetually delayed. It seems like they do not have a good concept of punctuality. In addition, cabin crew are average in terms of service and pleasantness. the hard product in itself is not something to be lauded. However, among all of it, it has always been the late departure over and over is the one that I think is the biggest pain.   Bangkok to Istanbul via Singapore. BKK to SIN on a newish B789 with a great new Business Class seat; comfortable and great IFE with a large HD touchscreen screen. Lounge in Singapore a rather mediocre experience, overcrowded with average food offerings. SQ lounge in BKK was much better. The big disappointment of this trip was the ancient B772 on the SG to IST sector. It was the very old business class seat which is very very uncomfortable. IFE was poor due to the small non touch screen. As usual, no amenity kit, the fresh flowers in the washrooms have been replaced by tacky plastic flowers. It is very hard to understand why the airlines provides a really good hardware product on a 2h flight, but is not able to do the same on a 11h overnight flight. Service and food on both flights was just average. SQ does not even come close to the business class product of Qatar Airways which I usually fly long haul.   Such terrible service from the outset! After making the booking which included a code share arrangement for 2 adults with an infant, everything started well with a bassinet being requested. From that point I had to call at least four times with apparent issues with the names on itinerary even though they were correct from the outset. This issue arises again upon attempting online check in which wasnÆ’??t at all possible because one adults name was somehow written in twice, once as a Mr and one as a Mrs. called and requested a business class upgrade. Was told due to code share it wasnÆ’??t possible (hello IÆ’??m trying to give you my money)! Thereafter we arrived at the airport to a very rude staff member once again telling me the names were incorrect in the system, even though the night before I had the itinerary emailed to me from Singapore airlines customer call centre showing correct details, after the initial attempt to check in failed, which confirmed names were correct, I showed this document as proof, lady appeared uninterested. codeshare 2nd leg of journey had tickets produced at Melbourne airport by Singapore staff and after being flustered by this to and fro at check in I didnÆ’??t bother to check the seat allocation for the 2nd leg which didnÆ’??t have bassinet allocation. To our horror we discovered the Singapore Airlines check in lady had allocated us seats in different rows on opposite sides of the plane with a one year old! How can they be so unprofessional? The worst part, when transiting through SIN I approached the transfer counter of the codeshare airline, which is SingaporeÆ’??s budget carrier Scoot and this helpful assistant was able to pair us together, making the MEL - SIN Singapore employees actions even worse. To top it off the flight wasnÆ’??t full, but also we cannot purchase additional baggage online due to once again the codeshare arrangement and furthermore we arrive at our final destination and discovered both our suitcases were broken with the wheels coming off before we exited the airport. Having flown many major international airlines overseas, I will never fly with Singapore again. ItÆ’??s an indictment on Singapore Airlines that the service and experience on the 2nd leg operated by Scoot overall in SIN airport and on board was far superior to the Singapore airlines journey to SIN. If going Australia to Europe, I highly recommend you consider a Middle East airline that shows accountability and pride in their responsibility to fare paying passengers. My wife and I are absolutely appalled by the service we received from Singapore Airlines. We have made this same journey to Europe 7 times as leisure travellers in the last 8 years and this was by far the worst experience.   For about 40 years my wife have used business class (including Singapore Airlines many times) for international travel;. On 6 July 2019 we flew Business Class, Brisbane to Singapore on SQ 246. For this Flight, Cabin Crew were excellent, food was very good, cabin was very clean. Seats were very wide. However, for sleeping they were the most uncomfortable seats we have ever encountered. They were hard, you had to lie at an angle and fit your feet into a very small cavity. They were sufficiently uncomfortable that we would never choose Singapore Airlines again for an overnight flight.   We flew Johannesburg to Singapore on SQ479 on July 7th in Business Class and experienced the worst most arrogant crew ever. I travelled with my wife and 2 Daughters (2 and 4 years old) and we were assigned seats 19F and 20D and F. As the seats are very closed, we would have preferred to sit all in one row, so we asked at Check In to be seated in one row, either 19 or 20. They told us it was fully Business Class, but they will leave a note and we can check at the Gate. We did, but the passengers on the window seats did not want to move, which was OK to us as they have been faster than us, so it is OK. Upon closing of the doors, we saw that Seat 20K was free, so I asked the flight attendant if my wife can move then from 19F, so we can sit in one row. She said this is a cockpit seat and she needs to check with the pilot. Upon departure she came back and told us that the pilot does not want to change the seat to 19F or 21K. Really? A pilot who used this seat for 30 minutes does not want to move one row back to let a family with 2 Kids sit in one row? Maybe SQ needs to inform pilots who is paying their high salary.   Singapore to Zurich. What a disappointing flight. Probably the worst crew I ever had, very inattentive. It was very hard to get any attention at all (the attendant button at your seat was completely useless, no reaction by the crew whatsoever) I had 2 drinks in a 12 hour flight. I wasnt asked for a drink with our meals and the meals unfortunately didnt save the day either. Most of the time we had to queue at the lavatory (the layout of the plane for PE is horrible), because the 2 lavatories were used by Economy as well. The lavatory situation in Economy was much better, nobody surely had to queue there (11 lavatories according to the seat map!). It didnt help that a family with two toddlers and a crying baby was sitting in the same row. On the positive side were the headphones (even if they had to replace my headphones straightaway) and the entertainment system. Avoid booking Premium Economy with Singapore Air, you have a better deal in Economy (or Business of course). Another weird point was that Economy class was disembarking before Premium Economy, another novelty for me. There are much better Premium Economy products out there.   Sydney to Rome via Singapore. First time travelling business my seat was literally located within 50cm of the toilets at the rear of business class. During this long flight these toilets were continually in use not only by business class but also economy class, and i was kept awake. I believe that these seats should not be offered as business class given there location. I would have rather spent the flight in economy class rather then being next to the toilets   London to Melbourne via Singapore. Average at best. Check in and baggage drop off hassle free. Lounge doesnÆ’??t have a great selection of food. As a gold velocity member with a third family member travelling on a different Star Alliance flight, she was refused entry despite gold membership allowing a guest, and travelling business class. I was met with 3 staff members who stuck to their guns. The lounge was quiet, but they assured me it would fill. I will never use this airline again.   Such a disappointment Christchurch to Singapore seats 33H and 33K, and SIN-CHC 32D and 32E in premium economy. We had really been looking forward to the new A359 taking over from the old 777 on the Christchurch to Singapore route with the choice of premium economy. Unfortunately, the bean counters seem to have designed the cabin! The configuration is 2x4x2 Æ’?? just one seat less than economy Æ’?? compared with 2x3x2 for Lufthansa in premium economy in the same type of aircraft, which we enjoyed for the next leg of our trip to Europe. The lavatories are the size of a small cupboard and there is no space to get up and stretch your legs in the cabin, unlike earlier aircraft. Going over was OK in the two seats by the window, but as others have pointed out, the central armrest and padded seatbelt (it contains an airbag) intrude on space. Inflight food and service was fine, if not memorable. Coming back overnight stuck in the middle seats was a lot worse. Space feels very tight. Not all menu choices were available, and we got beef mince, which was not very good at all. We asked for eggs for breakfast but got yam cake. A gentleman two seats along turned on his overhead lamp at about 3:00 am (he should have used the reading lamp). No eyeshades or earplugs provided. We asked for some but still got no sleep. Screens didnt work for two of the passengers in front of us. This flight ended up being diverted because of fog, adding six hours to the nine hour flight (of course, not SIAÆ’??s fault) but the whole experience was very tiring. One other thing: Electronic check-in at Changi was confusing and everyone had to ask what step to do next. It should be much clearer. We have flown with SIA for 35 years and feel they are trading on their past good reputation and really need to lift their game. Premium economy on SIA really isnÆ’??t worth the extra cost. It doesnÆ’??t feel special at all. WeÆ’??d probably look at Air NZ or another airline next time.   London to Singapore. First flight with Singapore Airlines in Premium Economy and what a disappointment. It had little to differentiate it other than a little more space. I ordered via book the cook which was a nice feature although my meal was delivered first and in asking for a drink, I was told to wait a while. I asked how long that would be and was told 2 mins and then it was suggested I drink the plastic cup of water given. Very cheap and nasty especially considering there was no drink on boarding or pre-dinner. 15 mins or so later the drinks arrived by which time my meal was cold but on my request they reheated it (another wait). The red wine was awful. Throughout the flight the curtains to Economy remained open so that didnt make you feel the extra expensive brought any benefit. The seat was not comfortable and the IFE was so poor I watched content from my PC. FAs were polite but not really interested. The 380 interiors felt old and indeed first impressions were of a budget airline. All in all poor value.  Singapore to Bangkok. Food standards have dropped drastically. Crew are a mixed bag - some attendants were friendly and helpful like the purser and supervisor and one attendant who went out of her way and offered to move me from my seat next to a crying baby and family to an empty cluster of 3 seats, 10 rows back before takeoff which was very kind of her. However, some attendants are grumpy and have zero manners. The seat feels exactly the same as a 10 in a row 777-300 on Cathay. Fairly acceptable for someone my height at 5Æ’??2 but could be uncomfortable for anyone bigger and on a longer flight. Food was terrible - fish was overcooked and the dessert was rubbery. Should have brought my own dinner instead. Only consolation was the Singapore sling and Baileys I consumed that was not diluted with ice cubes. Hot towel before takeoff is a rarity in economy for any other airlines. In flight entertainment is excellent as always with lots of music and movies which distracted me from the lousy food. However, for the price I paid, IÆ’??d rather go with Thai Airways which has way better food and more consistent service. Check in staff were rude and asked me to pay 200$ to take the earlier flight to Singapore when I arrived at the check-in desk 3 hours beforehand with a 4-hour layover coming from a domestic flight.   Hong Kong to Singapore. This flight without exception, was the worst flight Ive ever been on. The cabin crew seemed to be going through the platitudes of service but forgetting to actually deliver. In my case, I asked for a bottle of water instead of breakfast. Stewardess disappeared, meals were served, and expecting that someone would drop off the water after meal service, I declined the little cup that was offered to me during the meal service. That was a mistake and I just gave up so 3 hours later, I couldnt wait to get off the flight to get a bottle of water. Im a fairly low maintenance passenger, so Im not someone that will keep badgering the cabin crew for service. But to me this was just such a basic. Like how difficult is it to drop off a bottle of water to someone! I have a return flight booked with Singapore and to be honest Id have switched Jetstar but the flight time to work. Next time I wont pay double the price for a flight with Singapore expecting service. I might as well just use Jetstar!   Osaka to Singapore. There is no hot drink served When we received our meal, we asked for hot drink but they told us it will come later. It never came. We have not finished the meal, but they have already started serving ice cream. I couldnÆ’??t finish my meal in time and my tea never came at all. It seems like everything is in a rush. My cold drink not finished yet and the whole tray was collected. The standard has dropped drastically over the years. I choose SQ because I am Singaporean. There are other airline much better than SQ.   London to Singapore. Horrible first time experience. So they oversell the flight and bump me down to premium economy. Never again. They offered to rebook me the next day which does not work on a business trip.  How would you expect a first time customer to react.   New York to Singapore. We purchased the extra legroom seats for $120 per person/per flight. They are the worst seats ever. Yes, you get lots of legroom but you lose window, there are no windows at these seats, which is not told when you go onto the site to book, sleep, the lights never fully go out because you are right by the bathroom, plus you have the bathroom light shining in your face because no one ever closes the door, and you have to listen to the nonstop clicking of the bathroom door, your legroom, because people use your space to stand and stretch their legs and this is not monitored by the flight attendants. You are in the section with the crying babies, there is an actual section for babies. There is no storage space so you have to put all of your stuff in the overhead bin, and  you have to stow your tv during takeoff and landing so there is a good hour of just sitting there while everyone else is watching tv. I canÆ’??t believe we paid $500 for these terrible seats. If I had known I would have kept the cattle seats and stretched my legs on my way to the bathroom. Personally I think you should get a discount for sitting in these seats.   I cannot believe that this flight was the exact opposite of my last flight on SIA, when I went to the Philippines to see my daughter. Absolutely dreadful. This was a typical red eye flight, and Im at least 90% sure that SIA had reduced the leg pitch on this aircraft. Granted, I am 194cms tall, and that does not help the situation at all, but still, there were a number of things that were wrong on this flight. There was a gent in front of me who decided that he wanted to recline his seat back into me to the full extent, during taxi - it was ignored by the cabin crew. And it stayed like this for the remainder of the flight to Perth. I was served a meal by cabin crew with my tray table firmly poking into my chest. Not a single word was said to this gentleman in front of me by staff. Thank God we landed in Perth on time, I felt like I had to unravel my body to get off the plane. The passenger in question was only asked to move his seat upright about ten minutes prior to landing at Perth airport. In fairness, prior to writing this, I had written an email of my concerns to the airline. I was met with a we dont care kind of convoluted reply, probably from somebody who knows nothing about aircraft. I will be returning to Cebu to see my daughter at least two more times this year, but I will definitely not be flying SIA. I will revoke my KrisFlyer membership as well. I have flown budget airlines that are better than this. Buyer, beware! I would not recommend.   Booked a business class flight from Singapore to Manila on a Boeing 787 expecting a lie-flat seat. Upon boarding, we were informed that there was an aircraft change to a very old A330 plane without lie-flat seats. Seat was very uncomfortable, not worth a business class ticket. Plane was probably a decade old or more. Inflight entertainment is likewise outdated, not even a touchscreen. Lobster thermidor was salty, rice and asparagus were overcooked. Do not book Singapore Airlines business class, not worth it.   Shockingly rude staff, I had flown Singapore as a child with the fondest memories. Had paid double our tour group and opted for Singapore over a low cost Asian airlines. Totally regretted it - staff so rude to the children. Food awful. No drinks offered except one with meal. Total waste of thousands of dollars,  our group had an outstanding experience with the low cost carrier.   Hanoi to Cape Town via Singapore. I was very dissapointed with the way things were handled on 3 March 2019 before the flight, I was unable to board my flight, I let Singapore Airlines know via email, also tried calling but was unable to get through. I had to wait until Monday for anyone to help me and then got charged for a new flight ($584) due to missing the flight the day prior, even though I had notified the airline 6 hours before flight that I was going to miss it due to my Visa approval not arriving on time. Having paid this amount along with penalties for missing my previous flight has left me in a difficult financial situation so Im not impressed.   My wife and I flew Heathrow to Singapore return we have never flown in an aircraft that was so cold even with our coats on and using the blankets provided it was freezing. Also the food provided was amongst the worst had on a aircraft. ItÆ’??s a shame because the seats were fine and the aircrew fantastic. Also no delays at checkout and Singapore airport must be on of the best around.  London to Perth via Singapore. Having flown with Singapore before I was sure that they would be helpful and accomodating as we flew with our 5 month old to visit family at Christmas. We checked in the pram and car seat after paying to have them wrapped at the airport and had arranged to have a bassinet seat for the flight. This was all arranged with no problems. However, around an hour into the flight I was very aware that my baby needed to be changed. I went to queue for the toilets and there was 6 people ahead of me in the queue. My baby began to scream, IÆ’??m sure to the discomfort of the other passengers. I was very aware of this and decided to try and find another bathroom with a smaller queue. The only one with no queue and a change table was in business class. As I approached, one of the cabin staff asked where I was going. I said sorry, my baby is screaming I just need to change her she said you canÆ’??t use these toilets you have to go back I explained the queue situation but she wouldnÆ’??t budge so I had to go and queue with my child screaming and all the other passengers glaring at me. When we arrived at Perth airport we were annoyed to find that out pram was broken. Despite having it wrapped, it had been broken through the wrapping and the footrest was hanging off despite the fact we had only had it for 5 months. I checked the airline policies which stated we were covered up to a certain amount so I emailed them within 48 hours with the relevant forms, photos of damage, boarding passes and purchase receipts. They responded after a few days with a very unprofessional email basically requesting the same information I had already sent. I sent it again. Twice. They sent another badly worded email asking me to drop it off somewhere for assessment. By this point we had been back with our taped up pram for about two weeks. I responded explaining that itÆ’??s the only pram we have and we couldnÆ’??t drop it off. We had done everything they had asked. I never heard anything back. We were very disappointed and annoyed with the way we were treated both on the flight and the way our complaint was dealt with. I would never fly with Singapore airlines again which is a shame because I had flown with them twice previously (without an infant) and had a very positive experience.  Singapore to Manila. Overall a very bad cabin experience. 24 Feb 2019 - SQ917 KrisWorld down for the entire cabin.  26 Feb 2019 - SQ916 KrisWorld still down. reflected that I had feedback a couple of days ago on the return leg from Manila. 28 Feb 2019 - SQ917 KrisWorld still down. Steward was very impatient to the passenger in front of me when asked about the status. Disappointed that my feedback in the last few flights on the same journey wasnt considered at all. 03 Mar 2019 - SQ5254 Preferred meal was forgotten. I had listed a preferred meal in my preference. 10 Mar 2019 - SQ957 Lead steward conveniently forgot about my request. In the end I did not get any meals on board.   Perth to Singapore. Dirty tray table, bad cabin crew, poor special meal. During the day flight the window shades on empty seats were up and cabin crew were not bothered to pull them down and a couple of passengers went to do it themselves in front of the cabin crew who just started blankly and didnt do anything about the remaining blinds that were up. On the way to Perth from Singapore I was given the dessert despite being on the special meal but on the return flight, the steward proceeded to pass it to me but then retracted his arm back when he saw I was on the special meal, and no explanation was given. It was not any vegetarian meal as well but why is there no consistency? Worst thing was there was no explanation and he just walked away.   This was my 5th experience with Singapore Airlines but very different than the other 4. We had our Mumbai to Singapore flight delayed by 5-6 hours and eventually the 2nd flight from Singapore to Melbourne too got delayed however by 8-9 hours. We were made to stay in Ramada Singapore where the lunch was not made available to us, dinner too was compromised. We had a terrible stay and food in the hotel. Overall, I would not rate my journey a pleasant one.   Singapore to Hanoi. Although the service was great, I found the amount of plastic wasted horrifying. Everything was wrapped in plastic. There was even a plastic cup to put your water that was contained in a plastic cup. Wouldnt fly with Singapore again.   San Francisco to Bangalore via Singapore. I have flown Singapore Airlines from the past 20 years regularly until now, I considered myself to be a loyal customers. They used to care about customers before; apparently, being named the best airline in the world has gone to their head and they think they no longer have to satisfy their customers. I flew Premium economy recently to Bangalore and paid for the extra legroom seat--the flight was ordinary. I was expecting an offer to upgrade to business class before my flight and I have more than 50,000 pts. No such offer came--I tried to offer a bid, the system didnt allow me to. When I saw the flight, there were plenty of seats empty in Business class. Not sure why they dont want to offer the premium economy passengers to upgrade to business. Warning to everyone travelling from SFO--some connections to India have a very short layover--less than an hour. SA doesnt have any consideration that if the landing is a few minutes late and the connecting flight is within 30 minutes, they shouldnt make the passenger run from one terminal to another even using Skytrain. I barely made it before the gate closed (with my bad knees). Remember, you have to go through security in Singapore when you have a connecting flight. I had to rush from Terminal B to C with no time even to rush to the restroom let alone freshen up. While returning from Bangalore, I had ~4 kgs extra. Instead of asking me to pay using my Krisflyer (over 50,000) points, Singapore airlines charged me for a whole extra piece. So watch out, even if you are just 2-4 kgs over the limit in Premium economy, they will charge the cost of a suitcase. I even asked to pay for the upgrade in Bangalore, the said I cant do it in the last minute using points and I should check during my layover in Singapore (~ 2 hours). When I tried to upgrade for the longer flight SIN - SFO, they said that I dont have enough points. I offered to pay with points and cash--they said I cant do that. They just didnt want me in Business class even with points or cash! I wanted to avoid paying extra weight fees as I would have below the limit int Business class. If this is not an example of not caring for customers or accommodating its Krisflyer members, I dont know what is. Why cant they charge per Kg extra weight instead of an additional piece of luggage like other airlines?  Flight and food was ordinary (food quality has declined from SF to Singapore), and the bathroom cleanliness both ways was not up to par like it used to be. Changi airport is exceptional of course. I am not sure I will be flying this airline again while there are so many carriers who offer upgrades for a reasonable price and cheaper tickets. Not sure what to do with the balance points (more than 50,000 points) though. Sorry Singapore airlines, you lost a loyal flyer who has flow the long route for more than 20 years..   Bangkok to Dusseldorf via Singapore. During meal service SQ flight BKK- SIN and SIN-DUS I requested hot tea with lemon and coke. Flight attendant did not pay attention then gave me a salad sauce instead of coke and tea lemon. I was hocked and repeated my request for hot tea with lemon and coke. Flight attendant politely smiled and skipped my request. Dinner meal was without any dessert on international flight SIN-DUS. I was surprised there is no dessert. I asked crew  and they said no dessert and no fruits. During snack service they offered only mini potato chips and mini ice cream. There is poor meal quality on international flights and Singapore Airlines crew members were not attentive just poor attention and performed poor sloppy service.  Poor WIFI connection. Awful! Bad experience.    Los Angeles to Singapore. We booked a flight to SIN on Singapore Airlines in economy class from LAX for 11/2018. A few days before we departed, we received an email from them encouraging us to bid on an upgrade to economy plus. Even indicated what was a low bid with less chance of getting the upgrade, so we paid a higher bid that gave us a fair chance. Shortly before our flight we received an email that we were approved and could book our seats. We immediately went to the seat selections and found only 4 seats available, none together or even close. We called Singapore Airlines but they said there was nothing available and our prior seats in economy were now taken. We again asked at the counter when we checked in but same answer - no seats available. We are in our 70Æ’??s and had to sit rows apart on different sides of the aircraft for this very long flight. One of the seats was in the last row of economy plus and was so cramped it was very difficult to get in and out to use the restroom. We suffered. When we returned home, we found out Singapore Airlines would not even give miles for the flight since it was initially booked in economy. We requested our money back as we felt taken and deceived with the charge, lack of disclosure, and the unacceptable and poor quality service provided. They said no, terms and conditions protect them. Beware of Singapore Airlines offers as they may not be what you expect, especially for an airline that touts their reputation. We were extremely disappointed in their offer, service, and response! First and last time we will fly with them.   Singapore to Denpasar. Poor flight. Average food. No pillows available at the economy cabin. Old aircraft. Seats at the vertical position very uncomfortable. Ground service unpolite.

   
London to Bali via Singapore. I flew to Australia with Singapore Airlines 5 years ago and the service was out of this world, amazing. I flew last October with them to Bali and back and it seems that standards have slipped. It seems there are a lot more male stewards on board now and they seem to give worse service than the female stewardesses. Male stewards seemed disorganised, flustered and abrupt compared to the female stewardesses who were very organised and polite.  The airline needs to have standard procedures that staff follow. We had an issue with my partners meal being vegetarian nut free and Singapore Airlines were less than helpful. They served him nuts and or meat in a few of his meals, luckily he didnt eat them. When we told cabin crew that he was supposed to have been served a nut free vegetarian meal they said we never would have been promised such a thing because it didnt exist. When we showed proof of Singapore Airlines emails promising us a nut-free vegetarian meal the steward seemed disgruntled that we had proved we werent lying about it all. A female stewardess found something my partner could eat. Pluses: Female members of staff = fab. Clean and comfy aircraft. Pretty decent snacks and entertainment. We didnt pay to be sat together and yet we still were on each leg of the journey. Im giving it all a 7 because the journey was just about okay, it wasnt amazing like it was last time I flew with them   Paris to Brisbane via Singapore. Spent the extra to go Premium Economy. While the flight to Paris from Brisbane was relatively enjoyable, the return was not. The staff serving our aisle constantly forgot things. I was given half a meal (no diet restrictions) she just forgot to give the rest. When I realised because the woman across from me received her full meal (from the FA on the other aisle). I asked my FA for the rest. She said she would have to check if she had any left. She then proceeded to serve the rest of her side of the plane and then forgot entirely. When I pressed the service button, she came up and told me I had bumped it before even asking if I needed anything. I reminded her about the meal but she said they had all gone. I ended up with an economy meal then - no choice. My partner numerous times requested a drink and had to remind the woman 15 minutes later when nothing came. Then to top it off - For Christmas my partner purchased a new suitcase for me. So the return trip was its first time. It was a Samsonite Case and it arrived in Brisbane completely trashed. Plastic parts around the handle snapped off, dents so large it pierced the plastic the whole way through. My zip doesnt even zip up flush to the case any longer. I contacted the airline but they will not cover it.    Singapore Airlines is a totally different airline when taking the route Singapore to Stockholm via Moscow. The air hostesses are usually very service minded in Singapore Airlines and thats why I used to like them. But the exception is this flight through Russia. The air hostesses are mainly Russian and do not meet expectations in my eyes of the usual level of service that defines this airline. Furthermore, when exiting the plane in Moscow, prepare yourself for a nightmare. 1 long line which consists of all the passengers on the A350-900, needs to line up for getting a red stamp in your boarding pass. Then you have to stand in a second long line to get a green stamp in your boarding pass. Then there was a third line to the x-ray of the hand luggage before you could stand (not enough seats to sit) by the gate without any restaurant, caf?? or what so ever. And add to the misery that since i stupidly enough forgot my boarding pass to Moscow on the plane, I had to stand in a fourth line. Its very obvious this route is a failure. It is always way more cheap going through DME to and from Singapore than through LHR, FRA or CPH. Avoid Singapore Airlines flying to and from Stockholm through Moscow.   Singapore to Brisbane. Seems like service / food is getting worse slowly over time. Upgraded to business class for 1200$ from Brisbane to Singapore but SQ wanted 2200$ for Singapore to Brisbane upgrade. Amazing difference in the same sector?   Danang to Adelaide via Singapore. Our flight over to Vietnam was quite comfortable and good service, however, the return was quite different. My bag was severely damaged in transit from Danang to Singapore. I was given the run around at Changi by staff and have to hope that I can manage a damage claim via email. The Silk air flight (which was code shared on SQ ticket) was very average. Old plane, the meal looked awful. Service was very rushed and impersonal. Singapore to Adelaide flight overnight - no sleep due to extremely badly behaved child that screamed the whole time. Staff seemed oblivious and only intervened to talk to the parents when I requested them to do so. No food served until 5 hrs into the flight despite the fact everyone was awake due to screaming child. Drinks trolley never bought through. No snack service in galley like other flights do. Very disappointed. Food was average and service slow. I found it insulting that the IFE played a video showing all the features of the business class seat not once but twice, a lovely reminder to those in cattle class what they are missing. New A350 has poor leg room and when the person in front reclined i could not bend my legs and had to keep them straightened under the seat in front. IFE very average. Wouldnt go out of my way to fly Singapore again.   My experience was less convincing. The reservation line was always busy and it takes ages to get through. The seat is large and comfortable to sit, but to sleep it is not comfortable at all: too hard, too narrow footrest and you sleep in a diagonal position which is awkward. I could not sleep at all during the whole flight. And the food was really bad: very tough meat, overcooked and bad taste. Worst food I had in a long time. Staff is friendly but not efficient, sometimes it takes ages to get some water or bread etc. Overall really disappointing experience. A pity as they used to be good some years ago. In any case I will not chose them again.    I flew Singapore Airlines A380 business from Z?Â¬rich to Singapore in November 2018, and it was really a disappointment. Prior to my flight, I pre-ordered cordon blue for my dinner. It was just bad. Although the business section was not full, the flight attendants kept forgetting to deliver my drinks. During dinner, they offered red or white wine, and when I asked for a diet coke, they got lost completely. When I ordered a coffee, they gave me the coffee long after I finished my dessert but never delivered the stirrer.  The business seat is extremely uncomfortable. The cushion is hard covered with a thin layer of leather cover. Even adding the bedsheet wont help. The armrests are a piece of small folding plastic, I couldnt rest my arms comfortably on them. When I reclined the seat, I was unable to stretch my legs due to design of the leg room. One has to curve his/her legs to fit the shape of the leg room and it is extremely uncomfortable to sleep like that. The quality of the image and sound of entertainment is below average. They offered limited movie selections. I am usually very easy going with airlines and I dont like to spend time to write reviews. However the newly designed business seats in Singapore airline are unacceptable.  Singapore airline should pay more attention to improve their seats, foods and services.   Dubai to Singapore, with business class seated at 12A, the cabin was amazing, nice facilities with good ambience, cabin crews look nice, however some of the cabin crew are very robotic, there was no genuine care or personal touch from them. During the meal service, there was no one asking me to refill the drinks when crews saw my empty whisky glass, is it very expensive? Most of the crews without any anticipations for passengers. I can remember a female crew, when I asked for help to lay the bed back before landing, she asked me to carry her service tray for her, exchange? When she helped a lady seating behind me to lay the bed back, she put the blanket around the side of my seat, somehow the blanket slapped my head and I was shocked, when I was seeing her she just realized and said sorry! All the small details reflected that there is no attention for the customers, but some of the SQ flights I took before was so different! Honestly speaking, I was not comfortable this time and I feel there is no consistency for the cabin crew.  Really disappointed this time and not worth as a elite member anymore.   Mumbai to Singapore via Sydney. No kids menu provided for a 2.5 year old, they said they did not have any. The age is mentioned when you book the ticket. They gave instant noodles which is not I am some thing paying for, the flight includes meals.  We are non-vegetarians but other children with kids menu did not had a vegetarian option either.   Dubai to Kuala Lumpur via Singapore. It was my first and last time to use Singapore Airlines.  Both our flights had delayed for total 5 hours, which caused us to miss our next flight to Kuching. In addition, the food was really worse. I will never use Singapore Air anymore.   Sydney to Hong Kong via Singapore. The service that I received in Sydney Airport was so unprofessional. The ticket that I bought is student ticket, so I got 10KG more baggage allowance. However, the staff said that my baggage are overload (43kg in total). I  understand that baggages are overloaded, and I was happy to pay for the extra 3kg, so I asked the staff how much I have to pay for the extra KGs, she answer AUD270. So I chose to repack my baggage since I think it is more expensive than I expected. after I repacked (1kg extra), the staff asked if I can pay for the extra or not (I was surprised, since it is just 1kg more). Even though I understand that the ground staff are mostly outsourced, they are representing SQ, so I should expect professional service. The aircraft from SIN to HKG was very old that the screen is still is squared format. The meal tasted bad as well. I do not normally complain about the quality of the food as long as they are acceptable, however, I did not think that it is in an acceptable quality from world No. 1 airline. Thirdly, I am not sure if all airlines are like this or not, however, from the meal menu, they have 3 courses to choose, I was informed that they only have 2 courses though. The seat of A380 is alright, but not okay for the B777 since it is way too old. I did not think the staff of SQ is friendly too, you can tell that the staff of my aisle are tired of the job and did not want to serve. I had a really high expectation in SQ since it  ranked as the No1 airline, however, my experience tell me that it is not.   Dubai to Singapore flight was delay and I missed my connecting flight to Hong Kong. As it was airline mistake, they booked me on the next flight departing to Hong Kong after 5 hours. The staff at Singapore Airport arrival was not much helpful, they gave me SGD 15 meal voucher and asked me to wait in the public waiting area.    Frankfurt to New York. Both my original flight from JFK to Frankfurt (21 Aug) and my return flight (2 Oct) were fraught with problems on the booking end. Upgrades were a struggle to get processed. Seat selection was very hard. Customer Service was very difficult to contact, and once on the phone, they were largely unable to provide any answers or any help. Several emails have gone unanswered. I have never had a worse experience with an airline.   
Singapore to Frankfurt. I was a frequent flyer with Singapore Airlines. I was redeeming my miles and booked my ticket through SIA  directly. I received E-Ticket confirmation. But, when I reached airport with my family, they told me my child ticket (3 month) had not been issued. They didnt knew why. They ask me to pay a full price one way ticket at $800, instead of the $102 it was supposed to cost. I sent a letter after the trip and ask explanation and reimbursement. They replied after 1.5 month. They said they made a mistake with the code share partner and apologised, but they didnt reimburse the difference between what I was suppose to pay and what I paid without having any choice at the airport. In short they made a mistake but dont take responsibility. I have stopped using this airline. In addition we were not even together on the first row with bassinet despite there were available seats.   Could not fault the airline until they cancelled a flight from Singapore to Hong Kong on 16th September 2018. This was due to a pending typhoon affecting Hong Kong. No refund is forthcoming. A small discount was offered on another flight at a future time. This is not possible for us. The pre booked hotel in Hong Kong is reimbursing us the full amount less a small administration fee. If they can do this why cant a large airline do the same.    On a recent flight from Perth to Singapore, I was asked by the cabin staff whether I preferred beef rendang or western-style chicken for dinner. I asked for beef and was told that the beef sets on her trolley had run out, and I would have to wait. I was expecting her to get me the beef set from another trolley when, just seconds later, the stewardess abruptly placed a chicken set on my tray. She opened the foil to show me the contents and said that the chicken looks good too. Without further explanations, she went on to serve the others.  I was bewildered by her unprofessional and amateurish attitude. Not wanting to create a fuss and feeling tired, I just accepted what was given. This incident might seem trivial, but such small things do make an impression and affect my decision to fly with the national carrier again. The crew members just seemed to be rushing to get their jobs done, and the warmth of the Singapore Girl that is so widely advertised simply could not be felt. Apart from personal grooming and the technical aspects of their duties, I wonder if soft skills and proper service attitude are sufficiently emphasized during their training.    Three of us arrived early at Jakarta  check in counter at around 2.45pm. We requested to change our flight to earlier 5pm flight, the first counter lady rejected our request and we went to another counter and he helped us to change flight but then told us we have to pay for the change. We declined to take the change of flight and later we were informed there was delay for one hour to our flight. Why did SIA charge for additional fee knowing that there was a flight delay and make their customers to wait for 4 hours.   San Francisco to Bangalore via Singapore. Ticket was sold as 1 layover at Singapore. However flight stopped at Hong Kong and we were made to out for another security check. Three people family was forced to sit at three different seat including my minor child, Same meal was repeated.  We were given last seat in the return journey. There was no cabin space given for our seat and hence we had to put our stuff scattered in the plane. Meals were also mediocre quality with no fruits and veggies or salad.   My recent experience in business class was very subpar. First off, the seats were angled weird and made it difficult to sleep comfortably. The entertainment remote was also not very responsive. There were way too many announcements causing frequent interruptions in watching movies (and dont tell me they are necessary as Ive never experienced so many announcements on any other airlines). I booked the cook for all my flight meals when it was available. On none of the flights were any of the flight attendants aware that I had pre-ordered my meals. They always asked me what I wanted to order and I had to remind them that I had booked the cook.  On my last leg back home (Seoul to LAX), same problem occurred, but this time they forgot to serve me breakfast (despite being awoken almost 4 hours before landing). They served me the preliminary stuff but then I sat for another hour with no meal served. I went up to one of the flight attendants, and she notified me that she accidentally gave my pre-ordered meal to someone else. However, 10 minutes later, she came out with my correct meal, which tells me she simply just forgot to serve me. The head flight attendant was apologetic and offered me a 100 Singapore Dollar voucher to use on in flight shopping. He told me it was good for one year, but I have no idea if I am going to take another Singapore Airlines flight within the next year, and especially not after this poor experience. This was such a disappointing experience.    Melbourne to Delhi via Singapore. Flying Premium Economy was disappointing, over rated seating and food was average and similar to Economy - apart from slight extra leg room, it was not premium at all. Service was below average. Transit in Singapore was also disappointing as agreed requests to ground staff were not actioned on aircraft. After a long time, am using my KrisFlyer points for my wife to travel Business Class from Melbourne to Rome via Singapore on in August 2018 whilst I am travelling on a Business Class ticket. My wifeÆ’??s SIN-ROME booking using KrisFlyer points remains waitlisted on Business Saver Class despite 3 months of booking. Instead, Singapore Airlines wishes me to pay approx AUD$1,500 to upgrade my wifeÆ’??s Business Saver Class to the next sub-class. This is unacceptable and disappointing.  Despite being a loyal customer for over 30 years, a fair significant of which is as a PPS member until recently, the airline is unable to assist. Based on poor treatment to-date in respect of item 3 above, it appears that Singapore Airlines is misleading with its KrisFlyer program in that passengers are encouraged to join up but the ability to redeem points is difficult/a very long wait.    Singapore to Xiamen. I am extremely disappointed with Singapore Airlines! I am an United Gold customer. Before I booked my flight, I called Singapore Airlines to verify whether I can use the airport lounge due to my United Gold status. The staff gave me wrong info and as a result, I paid $100 more to book Singapore Airlines. However, at the airport, I was refused and was told that the staff gave me wrong info. They refused to correct their mistakes and give me refund.  This is ridiculous! The service was not any better than United and I dont even get the choice of meal that I want because they didnt prepare enough (only 25% of the meal is fish).   Wellington to Singapore. My trip was quite disappointing, the 777 aircraft are so old! The TV screen resolution is horrible. Entertainment options not the newest. The flight was delayed by almost 2 hours because of push back issues.  Service and food was just okay; nothing memorable.  With the high prices they charge, I dont think its worth it, but I still love the brand.  As Bi-annual visitors to Thailand, by recommendation, we went with SQ for a change having heard great things about Changi airport. This time we took our adult daughter too - the shopper. Unfortunately, all we saw of Changi was what we saw while running through the terminal, owing to our first connecting flight being delayed, then our second going tek and requiring us to change aircraft many hours later than our departure time. We were handed forms at the departure gate and an invitation to contact Singapore Airlines for future incentives. Infact, what we got in reply, months later, was in short: Safety first; we dont compensate for delays or connections - if missed (all our flights were SQ). Tough luck. Therefore our experience of SQ is one we wouldnt recommend and as they state, they wash their hands of you if you miss a connection even in the event that connecting flights are both SQ. As a former employee of a British airline operating the very same aircraft I feel I have enough experience to say this is at best a poor outcome from SQ. On a positive note, they make it easy to decide who not to spend your time airborne with. Also, my wife is gluten free, although requested, she had to skip some meals because they didnt have the gf option for her.   London Heathrow to Sydney via Singapore. Both myself and my wife enjoyed the overall experience, responsive flight attendants and very friendly. Our only real complaint is the food which we found to be rather unappetising and repetitive, perhaps a few European or English dishes would be a refreshing change and certainly more welcoming to our palate.   Aircraft was very outdated. Inflight entertainment audio was out of sync with the screen.  I order a diabetic meal and the meals I was due on this flight never came with a drink until the main service was undertaken. The last meal I was asked if I wanted tea or coffee; I replied water and it never arrived. Others were at least 40 minutes after I had finished my meal.    Sydney to London via Singapore. The seats in business class are awkward, to use the lie flat seat it is necessary to lie at an angle, and because of this it feels cramped. We left Sydney at 7.05 in the evening, and had the on board meal at approximately 8.00 pm, there was a choice and it was perfectly adequate. The flight to Singapore takes 7.15 hrs, there was a 1 hour change over of planes. After take off we were offered dinner again, which having already had an evening meal I passed. The flight to London from Singapore takes 14 hrs 35 mins. Breakfast is not available until 2 hrs before landing. It was served very late. I think the stewards should be aware of passengers who have been on the flights for 22-23 hrs, and be prepared to offer breakfast much earlier. We will not be travelling Singapore airlines again.   San Francisco to Bangalore via Singapore. I have been flying Singapore Airlines for the past thirty years. I have noticed a visible degradation in the quality of service over the years.  Ever since the introduction of the Premium Economy class, the quality of the service in the economy class has declined. The flight attendants go about their tasks mechanically, with little or no interaction with passengers. The food is mostly inedible. During my most recent flight, I opted for the Dim Sum breakfast between Hong Kong and San Francisco. The soggy, mushy items had no resemblance to Dim Sum items I have had anywhere. While US airlines such as Delta and United have vastly improved service for economy travelers, Singapore appears to be goading their economy passengers to upgrade to the significantly more expensive Premium Economy class. However, it is very hard for me to justify spending an additional $1000 just to get two upgraded meals and a slightly larger TV screen.   Frankfurt to Singapore. The flight attendants are some of the nit-pickiest Ive ever seen. My crime was sleeping during the pre-flight video. The experience was no better than average. The food wasnt special, the premium economy seat was a premium economy seat. It got worse on the way back when we stopped at the Star Gold lounge to discover what is the worse Gold lounge Ive ever been to. It felt more like a private waiting area than a lounge, it doesnt even have its own bathrooms. Singapore is doing the bare minimum to provide the benefits as part of Star Alliance.  Lufthansa gained a star - maybe Singapore needs to lose one.   San Francisco to Singapore. My wife and I were planning a vacation to SE Asia, so I bought round-trip tickets between San Francisco and Singapore on the Singapore Airlines web site. The next day I was looking for tickets to Siem Reap for a side trip to Angkor Wat when I discovered on Travelocity that Silk Air had the best flights, and that Silk Air was a part of Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines website did not make this clear at all. So I called Singapore Airlines to add these Silk Air flights to my booking. Imagine my surprise and disbelief when I was told I had to pay a $500 penalty because this Æ’??changeÆ’?? came two hours after their 24 hour change deadline. I talked to two of their supervisors, but they also insisted on this penalty. It did not matter that Silk Air was hidden deep within Singapore Airlines website. It did not matter that I was adding Singapore Airline flights to my itinerary. It did not matter that I was only 2 hours past their 24 hour Æ’??deadlineÆ’?? Since my Singapore Airlines flights were non-refundable I had no choice but to pay the $500 penalty. Just booking the Silk Air flights separately would have cost me an extra $690. In a situation that clearly called for a little flexibility and compromise Singapore Airlines showed none. For that reason they have earned my lowest rating.   Coimbatore to Melbourne via Singapore. I travelled with my 16 month old baby and SIA did not offer me a bassinet seat although I had requested for it before hand. They said that they have children younger than mine who needed it. I understand that but they should have offered me a spare seat or upgraded me to business class. I had to travel from Singapore to Melbourne with not enough leg room. On top of it the cabin crew didnt bother to provide any food for the baby. They didnt offer me an infant seat belt (I had to insist on one). Singapore airlines is not cheap and we pay the extra money for a comfortable travel. I have been flying Singapore airlines for the past 10 years and this has been the worst travel ever.    Chennai to Los Angeles via Singapore. I have been flying this route on Singapore Airlines for about 30 years. Although the overall level of service is good there has been a decline in passenger facilities and comfort. Their Business class lounge in Chennai is a joke with about 20 seats in a small enclosure resembling a neglected warehouse. The seats on the Singapore - Los Angeles segment are flat beds but they are difficult to operate. Most people needed assistance from the flight attendants to switch between the flat bed and regular seating positions. Meals are ok but nothing great. The in flight entertainment is below average. There is the annoying halt for just over an hour in Tokyo where all passengers have to disembark and go through security before re-boarding the aircraft. Overall Singapore Airlines will no longer be my first choice carrier unless they attend to these issues.   Guangzhou to Singapore with A330 aircraft. The timing of flight SQ851 is good for the people departing from Guangzhou and arrive in Singapore. The cabin crew are nice and some of them even could speak Cantonese. But due to an old aircraft the seat is not comfortable and the inflight entertainment system is no work for my seat.   Singapore to Guangzhou. The boarding gate in Terminal 3 A20, so far away. Cabin crew are nice and one of them is from Chinese. They offered supper and several types of drinks including welcome drink. But the aircraft is old and the seat is not comfortable, the ear phone is not work even I change for 3 times.   Frankfurt to Singapore, Business Class. I got an email early morning on 9 January to notify me that the flight  was to be delayed by 2 hours. As I was connecting with Air New Zealand at Singapore onwards to Auckland with a short connection time, I thought the chance of catching the connecting flight to Auckland was going to be impossible. That proved correct. Prior to arriving at the airport, I rung both SQ and Air New Zealand. Both airlines claimed it was each otherÆ’??s responsibility. In short, SQ was to blame for the disruption, so it was their responsibility to put things right. When we were due to board at Frankfurt, the A380 was not at the terminal, it was at a distant part of the airport so we were bussed to the plane which seemed to be miles away. When we finally arrived at the plane, we had to climb a set of steep stairs to enter the plane. Considering the delayed flight and the inconvenience we had been through, the greeting from the staff was very ho-hum. The crew seemed to be grumpy during this flight. The poor guy in front of me had a seat adjacent to the galley door way. He asked to be reseated somewhere else in the business section. The stewardessÆ’??s response was, sorry, we are fully booked. This wasnÆ’??t the case as there was a vacant seat behind me. The meals were very Asian, with a lot of seafood options, in some cases I chose to forego the course as there was just nothing I liked. I would recommend SQÆ’??s book the cook option. There are far more options available using this than SQ offers on the flight. Come time to sleep, my bed was broken. It lay flat ok, its just that when I put my weight on the bed the feet end of the bed couldnÆ’??t sustain the weight and my feet would go right through to the floor. I slept, but it wasnÆ’??t great. I wasnÆ’??t the only one to complain of this problem. When the flight arrived in Singapore there were a team of SQ agents waiting for arriving passengers whose connecting flights were affected by the delay. In all fairness, SQ did handle this very well, they provided a 4 star airport hotel for 12 hours along with 3 meals. The journey on to New Zealand continued with SQ and I can basically say, I saw a repeat of the service issues I had on the Frankfurt/Singapore flight. I canÆ’??t recommend SQ and probably wonÆ’??t chose to fly with them again.   Tokyo to Los Angeles. Cabin was clean and with decent space for knee room for a 53 female. Complimentary 2 bag check in which was nice. Amenity kit provided complimentary containing tooth brush, paste, and socks. No slippers or eye mask as other airlines. Bathroom needed to be better maintained as waste bin was full by hour 4 out of 12 hour flight, soaps in disarray and bathroom prep tray (mouth wash etc). Special meal service was kind although a bit disappointing as you do not decide what meal you would like to eat but it is already prepared generic western style of whatever meal selection chosen. I wouldÆ’??ve loved to pick my meal with the changes applied, especially knowing tickets were booked ahead enough. Food was decent, but often the crew would overlook my seat and miss out several beverage//snack passes due to special needs. This was not at all an issue flying USA to Japan. But an issue on this flight. Main complaint is how crew couldÆ’??ve done better to handle special requests with passengers. I booked and had a seat arranged, by surprise there were no shows in my row. Instead of privately making me aware of any request, an attendant publicly asked for my seating reassignment so that I may switch places with another passenger so that they my lie across the row with their bad knee. IÆ’??m partially deaf in one ear and spinal braced. Instead of privately requesting in writing, the crew member and requesting passenger makes a scene for me to move because I am unable to hear. So speaking louder while in flight should be better. There should be a better way for flight crew to handle those with special needs such as mute, deafness, and hidden disabilities instead of causing a scene or skipping passengers who cannot speak. Be like other airlines that have crew member buttons on the seat panels such where passengers can press for assistance or communicate needs.  Hong Kong to Perth via Singapore. Absolute disgrace. Randomly selected seats for my family all over the aircraft. Last flew with this airline a couple of years ago and it was brilliant. It seems poor now. Entertainment onboard was busted. I travel regularly and would seriously say that even a budget airline is better than Singapore Airlines. Do yourself a favour and give this airline a wide berth.  London to Perth via Singapore. I was expecting so much more. Not just the reviews but the additional cost of premium. The first leg to Singapore was poor. The air crew are fully engaged with economy and consequently are not seen. The second leg was so much better due to the air crews attitude and attention. Ironically the second leg was economy. Certainly on the first leg premium on the 777-300 I do not feel the seat justifies the significant increase in cost. The majority of passengers around me had been upgraded from economy. The economy seat on the second leg near the exit was just as comfortable so unless you are flying business I would suggest econony seat near the exit. Maybe the A380 is better premium but not the 777-300   Sydney to New Delhi via Singapore. The food (IVML) served on my flight from Sydney to Singapore was horrible.  I complained to the cabin crew staff and was not offered a replacement so went without food. The food on Singapore to Delhi flight was also below average. I previously always had an above average experience with SIA but looks like they are cutting costs. I pay a premium to fly with SIA and expect services of acceptable standards. Will not fly with them in future.   Singapore to Colombo in July 2017. The ground staff were quite rude and to wait at least an hour to check the bags in. The flight crew was also not the best and I found the food quite disappointing. Taking this airline because  not many other airlines are having journeys to Colombo.   Singapore to Paris. My husband and I chose Singapore Airlines for the first time to visit my brother who lives in Singapore. We thought it was one of the best company. Unfortunately, it has the worst customer service weÆ’??ve seen. Our return flight from Singapore to Paris was delayed by 3 hours so that we missed the connecting flight with Air France in Paris. All the flights to go home were full for the following 2 days. We had to buy by ourselves 2 train tickets (188 euros) to go back home. Our Air France tickets that we couldnÆ’??t use because of the delay were non-refundable. So we lost 246 euros because of SIA. After several mails to SIA (because they donÆ’??t reply to emails), the company doesnÆ’??t deign to pay 246 euros to compensate us. They only want to pay the difference between the train tickets end the Air France tickets (52 euros). Not logical. Plus, they donÆ’??t want to spend money to reply with postal mails. Only answers by email. Singapore Airlines donÆ’??t have consideration for their customers. They donÆ’??t take responsibility when their delayed flights have consequences on customers.  We will never fly again with Singapore Airlines.   Rome to Melbourne via Singapore. Check in Rome was quick, efficient and friendly but from there it was all downhill. Singapore Airlines use a common use airline lounge in Rome not affiliated with any specific airline. Lounge is very dated and standing room only when full as it was on this day. Food offerings were a stale pound cake and a bowl of nuts. The bar area was covered in dirty used glasses.  I left the lounge and bought water from a vending machine. The aircraft was a refitted 777 that looked every bit its 16 years old. The purser was very friendly and the rest of the crew in business class were also alright on the Rome to Singapore leg. The seat was large but very uncomfortable in seated and bed positions. The meal was not great and quality sub standard. The next flight out of Singapore to Melbourne while the aircraft was new was the biggest disappointment. The crew rushed both services and literally threw the table clothes and utensils down. Bread baskets thrust at passengers without offering bread. All done without uttering a single word to customers. From the noise coming out of the galley they were capable of talking and laughing just not with their customers.  I wouldnt have given more than 2 stars from their product and crew .   Tokyo Haneda to Melbourne via Singapore, we were bumped to an earlier flight in Singapore  with the reassurance that our baggages would be transferred to our new flight. Lo and behold, we arrived in Melbourne after enduring a painful flight in an old airplane with terrible food and fault inflight entertainment (had to be restarted twice) our baggages are nowhere to be found. Went to the baggage assistance area and talked to a very agitated agent who refused to explained the situation to us. Very disappointed with Singapore Airlines with this mix up. They are efficient when running smoothly within their protocols but anything out of ordinary reveals poor problem solving.    Denpasar to Singapore, my experience has been disappointing. The lack of pillow and blanket on board was a concern, even though it was just a short flight, and the fact that it was a day flight didnt mean that blankets were not necessary. The cabin temperature was freezing and when I asked the crew for a blanket, the reply I got was they have run out.  When the flight was approaching Singapore, we demanded for some disembarkation/embarkation cards, we only managed to get 2 for a total of 8 of us, because they have run out of these cards. In the end, we had to queue up before the immigration counter at Changi Airport to get the cards and to fill them in. The meal was very unsatisfying. Overall, the flight was just full of disappointment.   Singapore to Perth. A disappointing inflight experience with Singapore Airlines. Seats are old and stained. The inflight entertainment screen was stuck and the angle could not be adjusted. Food was too salty for me. Stained toilet seat and basin. Not worth paying more for these older facilities. The only positive thing is the good inflight crew service. Definitely not a 5 stars airline.    Guangzhou to Singapore. Singapore Airles has lost its service quality. Its virtually impossible to use my hundred of thousands KrisFlyer points for upgrades. The required ticket type is nearly the cost of the business fare in the first place!! Points have been progressivly devlaued with unecessary expiry dates. SQ is locked in the past. The budget airliens are beating it on service standards. There was a time when SQ was my preferred carrier. Sadly its no longer the case. The outdated one way vs two way ticket cost differential means I use other airlines more and more frequently becuase I need the flexibility in rescheduling flights. SQ should look at Jetstar Asia if it wants to see what modern customer standards are like. (Believe me I never thought I would write in favour of Jetstar.)  My experience with Singapore Airlines was decent at best. The airline fails to compare to the Middle East carriers such as Emirates. My Singapore to Mumbai journey was in an old 777 with a very uncomfortable seat that left me with a backache. The entertainment system on both the 777 and A380 were archaic and cumbersome to use. Definitely didnt feel worth the premium price that I paid for the ticket.   First time with Singapore Airlines. Got to Sydney airport early. Checked in online and dropped bags. Friendly ground crew directed me to Business Class check in counter as the online check in counter was busy with another passenger. No issues and was issued boarding pass seamlessly. Boarding at Gate 61, a bit chaotic as there are very few seats in that part of the airport for all passengers on a full A380. Departure delayed one hour due to bad weather but was handled professionally by captain and was able to make my connection in SIN. Meal ok, but cabin crew seemed almost robotic, rehearsed and fake. Lacked human touch and could probably be replaced by a few well programmed robots. Seat 60K in economy. After sometime realized my back was aching. Discovered that seat had no lumbar support, some did, mine didnt and couldnt fully recline either. Not pleasant for a 7 hour flight to SIN. Didnt bother complaining as crew was nowhere to be found after meal service and were happy to switch off lights and disappear. Entertainment system, a bit dated, probably the original system used with the first A380 flights and some buttons required a harder press on the remote as had been worn out. Had about 200 movies but I mostly listen to music while flying. Choice of music was mediocre, so decided to use my iPod instead. No free WiFi quota. Same continued on SIN-CMB leg except seat had lumbar support this time, didnt turn on entertainment system this time. I think SQ is highly overrated and not a patch on Emirates or even some non 5 star airlines. Would consider others before SQ next time.   Dubai to Singapore via Penang. First time fly with Singapore Airlines and will be final. I thought everything is perfect not until when I received my new luggage, with the Protection cover missing and the pocket zip is broken. When I file a complaint to Customer service, and the response is that it is due to the luggage is wear and tear, Singapore Airlines could not submit the damage claim to the insurance company and thats it. My conclusion, Singapore Airlines is very irresponsible, if you want to fly with them please ensure your luggage is wrapped or use the old luggage.   Singapore to San Francisco. I have an email with my itinerary showing the flight is from Singapore to San Francisco. There are no words about a 1hr 30 mins stop in Hong Kong. Only today I realized the flight is through Hong Kong. If I had known that, I wouldnt choose this company at all. The agent was surprised to see my itinerary as it clearly shows this is a direct flight.    Singapore to Paris CDG. Its been nearly 5 years since I last flew SIA and although just a single flight so far, I was bitterly disappointed. A380 business class section was looking a bit tired, seats worn and not the standards I remember. The biggest shock was how poor the cabin staff service was, almost from start to finish. Yes, they got the service done, but there wasnt a single smile or sign of expected service courtesy, they appeared bored and wanting to finish as quickly as they could. I fly a lot of other airlines around Asia, and whilst many of them have gotten much better in recent times, things seem to have gone the other way for SIA. Have the return flight next week and will update after that.  Moscow to Sydney via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Our airplane had a technical issue on the Moscow to Singapore (A350 SQ361) leg. Passengers were kept inside of the airplane for 6 hours while the plane remained on the ground in Moscow airport. SQ did not arrange return of passengers back to the terminal. Neither hot meal was served onboard only a pack of chips within 6 hours. Crew provided little and infrequent information. Some passengers panicked and disembarked. We missed our connecting flight to Sydney and had to spend an extra 9 hours waiting for the next flight. As a result of the delay I was supposed to go to work straight from the airport after 38 hours of the prolonged journey. The airline asked me to write a detailed letter describing what happened. I spent my time and did that. In return I received a standard email with apologies.   Melbourne to London return via Singapore. Have always Singapre Airlines with high regard until my most recent trip to London. When we booked in January 2015, we could not book premium economy on the MEL to SIN leg, as at that time there was no premium economy on this leg. This has now changed but only on some flights. MEL to SIN in Economy, an older plane with inflight entertainment screen to boot. The screen was awful, so if you flying on another SIA flight, hold back and watch the movies you want to watch on a better screen. Service was very average, IFE was poor, food was very poor. Singapore to London in Premium Economy The only advantage in taking premium economy is the seat pitch and thats it. This is a very poor attempt at premium economy and it is a complete rip off. Inflight entertainment was poor, a much larger screen, so great for movies, the only plus. My small hand held control panel did not work. The entertainment system kept resetting itself at the end of every movie or programme. One ear in the headphones did not work. Service was poor - In premium economy you are placed in front of economy and behind business class. The service is provided by the economy cabin staff. Could not call for service as my hand held control panel did not work. The toilets are down in economy, none near premium economy. Food was very Poor -  Economy class food. The only reason why Ive given a score of 2 is because they have the book the cook service, but that is still economy class standard food. Remember, you are paying double the price for this seat. Flight arrived 25 minutes late. Return legs London to Singapore in premium economy was exactly the same but this time the entertainment system kept resetting itself, the headphones worked and so did the hand held control panel. Singapore to Melbourne in Economy - the breakfast on economy is as poor as you get with airline food. A cold bread roll, hard cold butter, cold muffin, cold unripe fruit.  The TV screen on this plane was up to date but still had issues with it freezing. We had a seat between us, so basically it was the same as flying premium economy but without paying twice the price. I had made a complaint to SQ a month before flying and this complaint has not been responded to. On all counts SQ have really dropped the ball. I would not recommend Singapore Airlines, especially if you are looking to fly premium economy.   I flew from Heathrow to Singapore then Denpasar to Singapore to Heathrow. My outward flight was appalling. I am a deafblind traveller, the airline was advised of my condition and requirements by both my travel agent and my mother. On boarding the aircraft with my cane I was told where my seat was, and nothing else. I had no access to safety instructions or menus. No access to entertainment system, no knowledge of where toilets were and no access to help button. I did not know how my chair worked. I was completely ignored on the outbound flight. A complaint was made and I was advised my return flight I would be made comfortable, that I would have my needs taken into account. This was not the case, again the seating was not appropriate even though promised. Singapore Airlines did not fulfill their commitment to make reasonable adjustments to ensure my safety or comfort onboard their aircrafts. I could not see or hear as both main flights were night flights. I could not use the toilets as I wasnt told where they are. The crew outbound had no concern for my safety or comfort. I was denied access to all inflight entertainment and felt unable to leave my seat for 13 hours. This is totally unacceptable. Singapore Airlines have acknowledged their errors but not offered appropriate compensation - an absolute disgrace. My worst ever experience flying.   Singapore to Brisbane. I am a star alliance gold member for the last 4 years and regular traveler on this sector. Recently Singapore Airlines has decided to replace the regular A330 service with an older much worse Boeing 777-200ER service. I am surprised they would use such old dated cabin in this aircraft, my main concern is the poor qaulity entertainment screen, also the poor meal service now converted to a brunch and every poor standard, better meal served on budget airlines. There was no drinks service before the meals. I hope they review this and revert back to regular A330 service.   In September / October 2016 I flew with my wife around the world using in sequence Virgin Atlantic, Air NZ and Singapore Airlines. All in Premium Economy. The principal airline booked was Air NZ and their service in Premium Economy was excellent. Unfortunately our flights from Auckland to London via Singapore were very poor. The standard of Singapore Airlines Premium Economy was inferior to Air NZ and to a lesser extent Virgin Atlantic. Singapore Airlines Premium Economy is marginally superior to Economy class and vastly inferior to their Business Class. During the first hour of my flight from Singapore to London I made my concerns known to the senior cabin steward. He made a mental note but did nothing to show any reparation for the poor service except that he admonished his junior staff for serving wine in clear plastic beakers as opposed to the glass beakers provided alongside the plastic foil-topped water on the food tray. He explained that Singapore Airlines were relatively new to offering Premium Economy class. No welcoming drink, no menu in seating area, alcoholic beverages served in plastic cups, meals of appallingly poor standard, coffee disgustingly bitter, wines of a poor standard. Apparently champagne was available but it was not offered to passengers and I only became aware of it after a chance conversation with cabin staff while waiting to use the bathroom. Singapore Airlines offers very little in terms of Premium service in its Premium Economy cabin service.   Hong Kong to Singapore. I had high expectations of Singapore Airlines and may be that contributed to feel very dissapointed towards this overrated airline. Majority of people have an pre conception of this airline that is not true. The ground staff in HK is not Singapore Airlines, thereafter when I asked for something as look at my star alliance account they were unable. The plane B777 was old, uncomfortable seats. The food was poor and the IFE limited. Thr flight was late so I had to run from one terminal wing to another to not loose my connecting flight to Delhi. Appalling customer service in India. When searching for flights, Singapore Airlines is ranked as an expensive airline compared to others in the same route. I dont see why, poor service on ground and in the air, old planes, uncomfortable seats and terrible food. Lack of customer service.   Singapore to Jakarta. Check in really smooth, and without any troubles the staff guide us through the boarding gate, seats. Seat with a lack of foot rest, legroom acceptable, able to charge devices. Service was exceptional! Really good service. Entertainment with lots of variety, however my IFE hangs a few times. Meal was horrible. Tasteless and lack of fruits Overall, the meal is something they really need to improve on.   Brisbane to London via Singapore. Would not recommend flying with Singapore Airlines if you are a musician who values their instruments. Never had any trouble with taking my guitar on other flights but as I went to book into my flight at Brisbane I was told that it was not company policy to let people take instruments on board and that Id have to stow it under the plane. After a long discussion with the manager about how Ive never had any trouble before and that itd easily fit in an overhead onboard the aircraft she said to come back to the desk at around 9:30 when the crew would arrive, so I could ask them if I could be made an exception. I came back at 9 to be told that the crew had already arrived and said no so I would have to stow the instrument, I was then made to sign a form to waive my right to sue if the instrument was damaged before boarding the aircraft. I was assured by the staff that the guitar would be treated with the utmost care and I tried to put it to the back of my mind and enjoy the flight. Upon arriving back home Im sad to see the wood on the head of the guitar has split and two of the tuning pegs have been damaged meaning my guitar which has traveled the world with me is now no more than an expensive ornament. What made me really dissapointed was being told there wouldnt be enough room on the aircraft for my guitar and then seeing 3 overhead compartments directly next to me free of any carry on luggage and plenty of seats free for it to have been stored. I know its not Singapore Airlines policy to let people take instruments as carry on but Im less than impressed about being lied to about not having enough room onboard and the fact that every other airline Ive flown has had no problems with it. Apart from the guitar the flight was lovely, food amazing, staff were very friendly and the stewardess knew how to make a mean White Russian! Just wouldnt advise any musicians to take the risk and lose their beloved instrument.   Singapore to Tokyo Narita. The service was horrible with staff not as polite or welcoming as they use to be in the earlier flights experienced. I noticed the standard of service being dropped and the inflight entertainment system was horribly maintained. I ordered a drink from the air hostess but then she said that she wasnt free and would bring it in a while but 30 minutes passed no sight of her nor my drink.  The entertainment system remote being beside you at the seat was discomforting as whenever you pulled it your elbows would disturb the person beside you.   Flew Sydney to Amsterdam, returning from Paris to Sydney, both via Singapore in July. I had researched Premium Economy with SIA. The flight on A380 tended to be more comfortable with more room. Boarding in Sydney was chaotic and confusing. The A350 seat to Amsterdam was very uncomfortable (front row) and the foot rest was redundant - I am 188 cm tall and this seat is not designed for my build by any means. Service was generally good but not up to the marketing hype. Only offered champagne once on each leg despite the way it is marketed and if I wanted more if was begrudgingly offered. Food (Book the Cook) was okay. Considering cost and advertising this as a premium cabin, there was no sense of privacy or a little bit more exclusivity because rarely, if ever, were dividing curtains or wall dividers closed. This was more for the convenience of FA who were moving between Premium and Economy with food trolleys, etc. Many Economy pax took the opportunity to wander through cabin, especially when nursing crying babies. Also, noise, especially many screaming babies were immediately behind my rear row seat in A380 flights - very noisy (even with noise cancelling headphones). Certainly there was more room and a little more comfort but at what cost - I dont feel it was anywhere near value for money. My biggest concern and complaint, which I made to FA, and even to SIA customer service, on CDG to SIN flight (July 15), was when parents left their two boys in Premium Economy while they took themselves off to Business class. They did check a few times but basically the two boys were left to their own devices. I had to stop them from damaging the lights, the window shutters, clambering over their seats, especially the young boy of 4-5 years. The FA cannot be expected to keep an eye on two young boys and neither should passengers. In this day and age, this is a big concern. Anything could have happened to the boys. What if there was an emergency - who would look after them? They became very restless and eventually I complained to FA but nothing was done. The parents were inconsiderate, selfish and irresponsible. Singapore Airlines were disrespectful of other paying pax. As a passenger, why should anyones flight be disrupted and stressful due to others selfishness as in this case? This is not about whatever class your in; airlines must stop parents from abandoning their children like this for everyones sake. Also, if anything happened to the children, who is liable - the other passengers? the airline? Would I fly SIA Premium Economy again - I seriously doubt it. It has potential but if they dont deliver on their marketing promises, I will fly other airlines who do. Also it is disappointing that they cannot even respond to a written complaint. If you over-promise and under deliver consistently, you have dissatisfied customers. This was over 4 flights and I felt dissatisfied and disappointed overall.   Not so much (if at all) Premium. I flew with Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Melbourne (29/07/2016) in Premium Economy as part of a return trip to Colombo. This was my first time flying Premium Economy with Singapore Airlines, though I have flown it before with another large Asian carrier (which was a good experience). I usually fly economy with my partner for holidays and business class for work trips, so have some sense of the competition and product on offer. Im also tall (194cm) and fairly broad which can make fitting into standard economy seats a squeeze. I had read a few reviews before the flight (all positive) about the new Premium Economy offering from Singapore Airlines and was interested to see for myself. The boarding at Changi was surprisingly disorganised and something of a circus. There was also some delays with take off which appeared to put the staff into such a fluster they forgot to give us menus or the standard amenity pack. The seats in Premium Economy look modern and fancy but are surprisingly uncomfortable for tall people. While they provide a bit more leg room and recline it is hard to make much use of this in a comfortable manner, and forget about getting much sleep. The foot rest offers nothing other than an annoyance and a reduction of leg room. The staff were (on the positive side) not rude but generally unhelpful, unfriendly, looked bored and appeared to go out of their way to not offer anything that might be perceived as an extra (eg. another glass of wine, a second cup of coffee, authentic hospitality etc). The main meal was very small and surprisingly un-tasty. The snack before landing was meant to be chicken fried rice but I struggled within the minuscule dish to find anything other than white rice and a couple of bits of carrot. The meals were so small and mean I was starving by the end of the 7.5 hour flight. The wine/champagne (if youre very lucky you can get one glass) they serve in a plastic tumbler (unlike the ad). The staff also have a habit of leaving you locked in with your empty meal tray for about an hour, which I can only imagine is a crowd control exercise. The entertainment system was good with a reasonable range of titles though annoying compulsory ads at the start of each viewing. It has an bad habit of switching itself on while you are trying to sleep as the controls are right where your knee pushes into the side of the seat. Overall, Singapore PE appeared to me to be a very average Economy with a slightly fancier looking seat, though not one that is well designed or practical for taller people. The service is anything but premium, in fact Ive had better service in standard economy for a whole lot less dollars. My experience was nothing like the reviews I have read.   Travelled from New Delhi to Manila via Singapore. The ground crew did not mention anything about the flight delay and did not bother to ask if we had a preferred schedule for our connecting flight. The inflight service was terrible. I asked for earphones from three different flight attendants but was only given one when I typed my request on my iPad. The food was nothing spectacular. The ground crew on my flight from Singapore to Delhi insisted that I have my backpack checked in and argued that it was too big. I have used the same bag on my flights with KLM and Emirates and they allowed me to carry it inflight. I have high regards before with this airline but sadly their service has gone downhill.    Flew Singapore Airlines flight 421 Mumbai to Singapore in Economy on a retrofitted Boeing 777-300. Pretty disappointing. Boarding was delayed due to late incoming a/c. But no announcements at all - passengers got agitated when no boarding call was given even after 45 mins after scheduled boarding time, staff seemed a bit nervous. Not expected from SQ at all. Onboard, my IFE (seat 52A) didnt work properly. Screen was grainy and without colour, no audio. Crew tried to reset it, but still in vain. So ended up watching a movie on my mobile. Windows were stained too. Seats not very comfortable, didnt recline well. Not sure if its by design, or due to some technical fault. The check-in staff were very polite. Onboard, food was good. Had ordered Indian Veg meal, was of top quality. Toilets clean even after 4 hours of flight.   Singapore to Paris. I am very disappointed by the service rendered by Singapore Airlines to their Economy Class passengers. First, they changed my seat reservation for my long-haul flight from Singapore to Paris. As a result, I ended up not being able to rest much on the plane. When I queried them on this change upon my arrival in Paris, they sat on my query and took more than two months to reply with a respond that doesnt shed much details on what went wrong. It has been 87 days and I am still awaiting a satisfactory response. Having endured an unpleasant flight and getting no clarification on what happened has made me feel like the airline doesnt value or care about the interests of their Economy Class passengers. Given their relatively higher fares even for Economy Class, I would urge customers to think twice if they are intending to fly Economy Class with the airline.   This was a very bad experience, as the service quality of Singapore Airlines has noticeably declined. I couldnt understand why the flight was delayed for 40 minutes due to late passengers. While Singapore Airlines uses environmentally friendly cutlery on its short-haul flights the quantity of food served has been reduced. The unbearable thing for me was that I am a Gold member of Star Alliance, but on arrival to Denpasar I had to wait for 50 minutes for the priority baggage of this flight. The plane arrived at the gate at 21:07, but it was already 22:00 when I got my luggage. Finally, although the entertainment system interface was very nice, there were not many good movies and music options for me.   Its been a long while since Ive flown Singapore Airlines, and theyve consistently received accolades for their service, even in Economy Class. However, I was extremely disappointed with their service, especially the catering on board a 7hr flight from Brisbane to Singapore. The aircraft was a new A350, and I had a nice bulkhead seat which allowed me to stretch out. The inflight entertainment was quite good, and the redeeming factor for this flight. Unfortunately, the service and staff was mediocre, and not warm or approachable as I remembered. The food was just awful, especially for a medium haul flight, which consisted of meat and veggies just piled on top of gooey rice. Not even a salad or appetiser (which they used to serve), and a cold bun (there was an ice cream dessert). The washroom was filthy, wet and sticky floor, toilet paper in the sink, even just after the first hour or so, and clearly the crew did not pay much attention to cabin cleanliness (unlike other airlines, where Ive seen crew inspect the facilities and do a bit of cleaning). Check in and baggage delivery was fine at the airport (but this may be as I have priority status). But overall, very disappointed with how the quality of service of a reputable airline has declined so much.   What has happened to SQ. I believe since COVID they have embarked on a wide ranging cost cutting exercise focusing on charging as much as they can for flights while skimping on what they offer customers. It starts with the lounge which resembles a crowded bus station where you need to search for a seat. Bring back the old lounges! On the flights there are no hot towels. No newspapers. No nuts before dinner. No amenity kits. No mattresses.  Food is mediocre. The only thing that hasnÆ’??t changed is the first class cabin crew. I have been a flyer with SQ for over 25 years and have never known it so bad.   
We used this airline recently for our trip to India and will not recommend this airline . Both ground service and cabin crew service not very friendly neither very welcoming. For a 16 hour straight flight you get two full meals and the snacks are just some nuts. No sandwiches are offered unless you ask for it. Meal services are also different, kids are not served first always.(sometimes yes they do). Meals also has no varieties like others  like no fruits or yogurt. We were very excited when we got the tickets as it was our first time using this airline but will not use in the future.   HND-SIN was pretty poor. Cabin staff didnt seem very happy. Virtually had a bread roll thrown at me. Meal (only one on a 7-hour flight!) was not hot enough - cold in places - and tasteless. Bag drop at HND was a disgrace - the online check in queue moved faster than the other one - with only two desks open it took 40 minutes. There seems to be no benefit or reason to checking in online. The Singapore Airlines app is not very good either. SIN-LHR-SIN were better. Good cabin staff and service, and the food was hotter and better. Bag drop at LHR was smooth. Boarding well organized and smooth. The pilot explained a touch and go landing at LHR well and there was no panic, but it did mean we were 20 minutes late - and we were already a little behind schedule. Singapore airport is a pain as every gate as its own security check, which took quite a long time on the outward trip. I prefer airports where no further checks are needed for transit passengers. SIN-HND was better and the meals were quite good, as was the service. Plane was old, though. Booked the tickets eight months in advance, and they were never cheaper, yet they were only reasonable. Wi-Fi is only available if you register your Kris Flyer number before you board, which I couldnt because Id already registered by ANA Mileage number. Why have this restriction?   Very poor service from flight attendants. There was no menu and couldnÆ’??t understand what the attendants were offering for a meal because of the mask. Food was served few hours into flight. Wine selection was bad. Never saw the flight attendant after the first meal on an 18 hour flight Was woken up 8 hours into flight to ask if I needed lunch Never saw the flight attendant after that. No toiletries provided.   Left 2.5 hours late and we almost missed our Singapore Airlines connecting Flight as the Skyrail between terminals was not working and we had 25 mins to get from terminal 1 to Terminal 3. When we arrived at the gate we were told to go to, By Singapore Airlines Sign as we Departed our flight. The gate was shut. We found out by a passerby that the gate changed 2.5 hours previously and was now another 10 mins further on, we made it but our luggage did not. We got on plane to find we were seated separately.  We booked in with staff together & we arrived together. We got to Manchester and were told luggage would be about 4 days. on the 5th day we went to the Airport 2 hours later we emerged hopeful & our baggage arrived on the 6th Day only to find the suitcase with missing roller & damaged. We had to use our own money to buy underware, toiletries, clothes for 2 people & a suitcase. This will be refunded but in the meantime we had to use our own money. I get to the airport to fly out this morning & there is no register of my Vegetarian meal on departing flight and I did enter it at the same time I did the previous flight.  We lost 1/3 of our holiday 100% due to delays. We were allowed to go to the Business Class lounge on the way out as compensation, I should be grateful for Vegetarian Sausages before I leave & a glass of Wine.  Compensation should have been upgrade to business class. We paid extra Premium Economy as we thought it would be more comfortable and relaxing but couldnt have been worse.    Very slow and poor customer service from Singapore airlines. I flew from Johannesburg to Bangkok on 20/05/2023. Upon arrival, I noticed my luggage was damaged (the bottom of my bag was broken and the wheel broke off). I contacted Singapore airlines for assistance. they replied with several different emails requesting documentation and pictures which I sent. I am flying back to Johannesburg tomorrow (29/05/2023) without a bag I can use. Ive indicated the urgency to Singapore airlines but theres no regard for this.    Not such a great way to fly. I booked an air ticket and the flight departure timing was brought forward by 7 hours. We had the option to accept, reschedule or cancel to get a refund. I chose the third option but was put thru multiple individuals who do not seem to know what they are doing (each contradicting the other) but eventually, I received an email to say the refund was being processed and it would take 6 weeks. Well, it was the 6th week yesterday and I wrote in to enquire, only to be told they will be processing it now. Today I received another email (a proper refund notice this time) to say it will be another 6 weeks for the refund to come thru.    We travelled on Singapore Airlines many years ago in economy class. We travelled this time in business class because of the long flight. The service provided on the latest trip was very good, however we did pre order some food that disappointingly did not arrive but the flight menu options were good. The biggest problem we had was the seating arrangements in business class, the seats were hard and uncomfortable. A weird cover was provided to increase comfort. The problem was no calf support and any way shape or form, this has a big impact on leg comfort. There was a flap thing that came out but onlyto the back of the knee which was so useless. The second problem was there was no tunnel to slide into for a flat sleeping position. Instead of the tunnel there was a shelf that had to be pulled out but this was to the side of the seat. Instead of laying flat which we were supposed to achieve the side shelf meant sleeping at an angle which was so uncomfortable. I do not understand why Singapore Airlines would ever believe that their seating arrangements would provide comfort. Cost is huge for these additional benefits for both comfort and health as older people travelling. The outcome is of course we wonÆ’??t be travelling business class with Singapore Airlines again which is really sad.  I find it appalling that SAÆ’??s flight attendants allow children seated in Economy to come visit their parents in Business. I didnÆ’??t pay in excess of $5000 per ticket to be sharing the aisle with other people and be irritated by the noise produced. I was seated in 17D, the person in question was in A17, his child came at night and they played loud games, I was hearing the childÆ’??s talking and laughing through my sleep. I believe that itÆ’??s not professional behavior on the part of SAÆ’??s FAs and they shouldnÆ’??t be allowed to place parents and minors in different classes, let alone let the visitors in, no matter what age. I will not be flying Singapore Airlines any longer unless this problem gets fixed.   When booking my flight I advised the travel agent I am a coeliac so need a gluten free diet, but I also have allergies to dairy and egg, so needed a GF Vegan meal, thinking this would be the easier option. When I boarded the flight was advised I could have either the GF meal or the Vegan. As the GF had dairy in it was not suitable, and the Vegan has gluten in. They advised me to contact the staff at the airline when I arrived to organise the return flights.  I had fruit which the lovely cabin crew sourced from business class and a bag of potato chips.  I contacted our travel agent to be informed I was listed for the GF vegan meals. So contacted Singapore airlines, the person I spoke to said it was not acceptable that I needed a combination of the two they only dealt with one allergy per person! I would need a Drs certificate if I had to have it. He then told me to take my own food. Which I ended up doing, but the amount of room available on the plane is minimal and awkward to get to bags when youÆ’??re elderly. Again the crew managed to source some fruit for me.    We had this unpleasant experience while flying with Singapore Airline SQ 622 on July 9th, 2023 at 13:55 from SIN to KIX airport. One of the staff at the plane door who supposed to help my wife to cover the baby stroller with a plastic bag refused to do the job with ours and ask my wife to do it by herself. We saw him covered others baby stroller with a plastic bag in front of our eyes but refused to do the same thing with ours. This is unacceptable and very rude.   Singapore Airlines still has not reimbursed me for my lost bags back in early January. After fighting them for months they finally agreed to give me some money for losing my stuff. They approved it back on May 18th. They said please allow a month for final approval. Here it is July 17th and still nothing. Singapore Airlines has by far the worst customer service I have ever seen. Please do not fly Singapore Airlines.   I have always had a good cabin experience with Singapore and been a Gold Member for decades. However a recent baggage issue has left me gobsmacked by their tardiness and callous behaviour. Landed in SIN on a stopover and noticed my Delsey case (only 12kg total check in) had a 6 inch case fracture. I reported it and received a case number. On arriving into Cairns the next day, there was no customer service representative visible so I could not pursue the matter. After calling SQ in Singapore after 3 weeks I was finally emailed by a local representative who saw the bag damage photos and offered 100 dollars full settlement for a new bag worth 400 dollars.  The experience has let me reconsider any future SQ travel plans.   We were given a flight with Scoot from Bangkok to Singapore, and then with Singapore to Auckland. The flight with Scoot was perfectly acceptable but what was not was that they decided that we must collect our boarding pass in Singapore which might have been OK but they they never told us where to collect them from, so we we spent ages trying to find the location and only just made it to the gate in time. The previous leg from Milan to Hanoi involved a Scoot flight and we received all our passes in Milan. On the flight when meals were served the crew just appeared at the seat with a tray whilst we were dozing and expected us to put out the table. As we had ordered book the cook, the main meal service took a while and we had finished our meal before drinks were offered. Premium economy food was no better than Economy fare and considering the cost of the flight a little more thought could have gone into the meal.    I have never come across a company that would ask a customer to pay a penalty fee for switching from a cheaper to a more expensive service. I bought a one way Economy class ticket from the US to Singapore at first, planning to take another airline for the other leg of the trip. Being a loyal customer of Singapore Airlines, I decided to be more generous and pay a lot more to buy a 2-way Business class trip in place for the original one-way Economy class ticket. I cancelled the one-way Economy class ticket after buying the 2-way Business class ticket and found that Singapore Airlines charged me a cancellation fee of US$200. I called Singapore Airlines and wrote to ask for the US$200 cancellation fee to be waived and refunded. The experience was a nightmare and the response was shocking to a long time customer. It took a long time to get through the hotline. My request for refund was rejected with no good reason provided.     Although the aircraft is good with flat beds and the crew is good, the onboard selection of entertainment does not compare to other airlines. The meals are low quality for Business class. Also I find the seats not as comfortable as others.   The airlines check-in staff charged me an extra $200 for a 10kg backpack, just slightly over the 7kg carry-on limit. This experience was incredibly frustrating and inflexible.    Seats that we paid for and confirmed very much earlier had been unfairly re-assigned later on to another person who was their preferred customer without first obtaining our consent or approval; SIA customer service initially informed us the seat was re=assigned due to flight schedule change but it turned out to be false. When they realized, they were wrong, they subsequently changed their position to cancellation and re-booking of our flight by their customer service agents. We did not cancel the flight but it was an error committed by their customer agent. . When the customer service agent re-booked our flight they ensured us that our original seats selection would be the same. We periodically checked with the customer service agents to ensure that our original seats selection were intact. They confirmed and re-confirmed that our original paid seats were unchanged. We also went on to their on-line booking website to confirm that our original seat selections remained intact. On checking in (2 days before flight), we discovered that one of our paid seats was re-assigned to another customer without our prior knowledge and approval. We discovered our seat was re-assigned to a standard seat to the back of the plane. Immediately. we called the customer service agents immediately on the phone to reinstate our paid seats back but they refused to do it. The customer service agents on the phone did not converse well in English and they gave us all the wrong information about the seat change. It was extremely difficult to get through to them on the phone and we had to wait for a long time before we could speak to someone.  The duty manager at airport informed us our paid seat had been changed last minute due to a preferred customer had kicked us out due to his importance. It was unprofessional and unethical for them to do that. We had to fight and argue fervently all the way through at each encounter. Even at the gate, we had to fight and argue to get our seat back after seeking approval from the preferred customer. Escalated the complaints to the senior management (CEO) several times who did not even respond to our complaints.. Actual costs incurred to resolve the airline mistakes amounted to SGD429.65 and they only agreed to issue a voucher of SGD75 which is inadequate to compensate for the actual costs incurred. Moreover, it does not include the additional inherent cost of lost vacation time and stress/frustrations to deal with their mistakes that they had created for us unnecessarily. Customer service investigation focused mainly on the outcome but do not provide fair customer resolution to their mistakes they had committed. The last response received from the customer service agent was that they are happy with the investigation and no further communication and action would be taken i.e. refused to address their mistakes committed and refused to compensate the costs that we had incurred.   They never placed my 2 bags on my flights from Rome to Singapore and onto Penang. I have airtags and the app shows exactly where they are and Singapore Airlines refuses to use this information and continues to tell me that they cannot find my luggage. I am stranded in Penang with only the clothes on my back. They have completely destroyed this travel experience. I attach a pic of where my bags currently are at Rome airport!   We were booked in on seat numbers 62j to 62k as a family of four. At the time of the meals, when requested for a chicken meal we were only offered an option of fish or vegetarian. As there was no chicken available, my kids were given a fish meal that they could not eat. I refused a meal, as I was unable to get a chicken meal. What I was given to understand by the head stewardess that there were not enough meals on the flight. What baffles me is how can the earlier economy seats in the plain get what they want, and we as a family in the latter half were not even given one chicken meal. No where on check-in were we given an option to choose our meals too. Even the head stewardess was of the opinion there was an issue with the allocation of meals.   We were booked on Business from Johannesburg to Singapore in October and was asked to provide the credit card used to purchase the ticket for my husbandÆ’??s ticket some 11 months ago. Apparently this was flagged by SQ system at checkin and we need to provide said credit card for checkin staff to scan into SQ system in order to allow us to get his boarding pass. Otherwise we need to sign an indemnity form or risk denied boarding. Fortunately, I did have the credit card used 11 months ago when I booked his flight or both of us would end up in Johannesburg stranded! Reason offered: 1. Fraud detection systems picked this up based off determined parameters. When I challenged this because 11 months SQ would have been paid in full and their ERP system should have the information. 2. Next explanation: within a 12- hour period we charged many transactions on card. When I provided the data which showed we never charged anything within 12 hour either before or after . 3. Their system algorithm is correct in picking this up as fraud and good for customer! Empty assurance of prevention when SQ has not provided any explanation how this event was picked up! I am still waiting for someone more senior to pick this upÆ’?? Interested to ensure that this will not happen to any other passengers who booked tickets at least 3 months in advance of travel date let alone one year ago!  We had the most horrific check-in experience with Singapore Airlines on Nov. 7th flight SQ 25 from JFK to Frankfurt. The check-in area barely had any travelers when we arrived and we were greeted by an agent immediately. The horror began. Our ticket was a one-way ticket since we were going to Split, Croatia (our final destination) for a longer time period for us and, especially, our toddler boy (29 months old traveling with me and my wife of course) to enjoy time with family and friends. Therefore, we purchased an airline ticket for each of us and chose Singapore Airlines as a well-respected travel provider. Each of us had 2 check-in luggage, one carry-on, one backpack, and a car seat for our son. Leaving for an extended period of time with toddlers requires carrying a lot of luggage and we carefully packed it all, measured it, and tried to pay for extra weight online before flying. There was no option for it. As I was taking care of our son, my wife was checking us in at the counter (the first class counter right next to the business class counter in Row 8). I noticed that she became visibly distressed and that the agent was on the phone holding off the check-in procedure. I asked if everything was ok and she responded that the check-in agent was not letting us check in. What he and his supervisor who he was on the phone with, and who seemed to be a business class agent right next to us, said equals absolute harassment and a complete overstepping of their boundaries. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to purchase a separate return ticket each because we wonÆ’??t be let in to stay in Croatia. This is unheard of, absolutely wrong, and untrue, a situation created by the agent and his supervisor that doesnÆ’??t exist. I am Croatian and an American citizen, and my wife and my son are American citizens who can enter Croatia with American passports as they wish. Then, the agent (still on the phone with the next counter supervisor) asked my wife if she had at least $8000 and after taking my Croatian passport said it would be fine for me but not for my wife who never changed her name - so was asked to produce proof of our marriage. Thankfully she carries our marriage certificate in case of this but for other countries as we travel - not for the US! And this interrogation happened in an atmosphere of hostility where the agent and his supervisor, who at some point was having a laughing chat with one of his colleagues, behaved with utmost disrespect towards us as their/your client/customer. Zero courteous smile. Zero understanding. Zero any sort of empathy that we have a toddler with us. We knew that we would pay for extra weight in one piece of luggage (the 9 kg option we couldnÆ’??t do online). They proceeded to make us check our two carry-ons that were barely over 7kg (and this has never happened to me or my wife in our 25 years of global flying) at a cost of $700. The Crew and flight were great. The food was horrible and the seats were not too comfy. Also, the customer service was almost ignorant of our complaint and defended their agents actions without any understanding. Never again Singapore Airlines.   The customer service is a nightmare. I have spent days on the phone since I booked my flight 2 months ago. I booked a flex fare to be able to reschedule my flight but the homepage is not working - same as the staff on the phone that tells me a different story about why I cannot reschedule every time.  Never again.   Book early coming 2024 ticket suppose SQ101 launching JunÆ’??24 and now received email say SQ101 is not operating due to operational reason. They suggest swapping my itinerary to one day earlier to SQ127 result long layover time in SIN and aircraft change from Boeing 737-8 to Boeing 737-800NG for real was ex-MI aircraft.   We booked our ticket well in advance for our return trip from India from CCU to Perth via Singapore and after few days SIA changed the flight timing later, from originally scheduled 7.40am to 7.20am. We boarded the flight from CCU and flight landed 1 minute before time. Upon landing we have received the notification that our flight has been rescheduled and it will depart at 9.30am. As mentioned before we booked well in advance and paid extra money for forward seats. However with utter surprise we have noticed that they have allocated us three different seats that too rear of the aircraft. While contacting the Transfer desk the customer service lady told us it is not possible to provide us any other seats so that three of us can seat together. She was very rude and not suitable for this kind of job. Being a Krisflyer Gold member this is very disappointing and not at all expected from SIA.  Barely any room to move, woke up to getting my knee crushed from the passenger in front of me reclining there seat back and was told itÆ’??s within their right to do so. Would not recommend flying economy with them if you are 6ft or taller.   I flew on SQ217 from Singapore to Melbourne on the 4th of January. My flight was terrible. To begin with my seat was broken and couldnÆ’??t be moved and the entertainment device was broken as well. My flight of nearly 8 hours was spent looking blankly into space, seated in the same position. I had severe back pain upon arrival as a result for the next couple of days. When I informed the crew, first the steward said I will be compensated with a voucher and asked me to choose what I like from the duty free catalog. When I did choose a product that would be useful for me, I was told by the air hostess that my voucher is only for $75 Singapore dollars and the rest will have to be paid by me! I informed them I donÆ’??t need their $75 voucher and that I will make a formal complaint about the planeÆ’??s defects. After my return I did make the complaint and they got back to me saying that another travel voucher of AU$200 will be issued to be used in my next flight with Singapore airlines. But the worst part was they lied and said I was offered another seat but I had declined saying I wanted to be seated next to my husband. This was an outrageous lie. At no point did they offer me another seat. This is very concerning. I would urge everyone flying in SQ next time, to either video any exchange with the crew in situations like this or get it in writing. After discussing with my husband, I informed them that I would not be flying with them in the near future so they can give me a cash voucher. But they replied saying they can only give me a voucher to be used for my future bookings through Singapore airlines. I refused to accept it because I will not fly with them in the future. Even a budget airline would have been more comfortable than this flight. But the greatest worry is their dishonesty.   For my final trip booked for July 2024, Singapore cancelled my return flight from Istanbul to Sydney. Both the travel agent and I have been trying to get in touch via phone, sms and online forms and they are not responding at all. The travel agent no longer wants to know after a month and a half of trying, they sent me an email for me to try direct, Singapore will not speak to me despite my telling them the agent has wiped his hands of it. Today I found out I will not get my full refund if I were to cancel because the agent took out travel insurance on my behalf without advising me at all. I always have my own travel insurance why would I need another.    I embarked on a journey with high hopes and anticipation, having secured a connecting flight ticket from Penang to Singapore, and then onwards to Jakarta. Opting for Singapore Airlines, renowned for its outstanding reputation in both air travel and service, I anticipated nothing less than a seamless experience. The cost of this connecting flight amounted to MYR 1601, roughly USD 335, a price I was more than willing to pay for quality service. My journey commenced with a minor delay in takeoff from Penang. The flight proceeded smoothly, accompanied by a light snack comprising a slice of pizza and a beverage of choice. As we approached Changi Airport, the situation took an unexpected turn. The captain announced a delay in landing, estimating an additional 15 to 20 minutes before touchdown. A sense of unease crept over me as my connecting flight departure time loomed closer. Despite my concerns, I remained optimistic, trusting in the efficiency of Singapore Airlines to navigate any challenges seamlessly. Upon landing at 12:05 pm and disembarking at 12:18 pm, I was met with a startling realization. Rather than a smooth transition to my connecting flight, I was handed a new ticket, rescheduled for departure at 4:10 pm, accompanied by a SGD 15 food voucher for Burger King and Coffee Bean.  I sought clarity from the attendant, only to be met with dismissiveness. The absence of any acknowledgment or attempt at redress left me deeply disappointed. The disregard for my time and the indifferent handling of the situation underscored a gap in the airlines commitment to customer service. In retrospect, my expectation for exemplary hospitality and proactive problem-solving from a reputed airline like Singapore Airlines was regrettably unmet. As I reflect on this experience, I am reminded of the importance of genuine care and consideration in customer service, particularly in moments of inconvenience or distress.   Boarding process went smoothly, and plane left on time. I had a window seat in the first part of economy section. The plane has 3-4-3 layout. We were 3 adults on this row, and it was very narrow. When the passenger in front of me, reclined his seat, i could hardly look at my screen, and could not fold out the table. The crew told people to raise up the seat backs during the meal times. We had two meals, dinner and breakfast, both meals were ok. I wanted to charge my phone during the flight, usb charger wad not working. I remember many years ago, when travelling with Singapore Airlines, the drink trolley came before the meal, and again when you got the meal, and they showed up again shortly after the meal also. Now you just get drinks along with the meal, and they do not ask if you want a refill. Very ordinary service and not very friendly staff either.  This flight was over six hours long on a B737 MAX8. I booked an emergency exit row seat by the window. The seat is absolutely dreadful. Lacks padding, and within a few hours, developed back ache that lasted for several days after the flight. The left and right armrests effectively reduce the working seat width to 12 inches. The B737 MAX is not fit for purpose for long haul flights and I would recommend that you do fly on this aircraft unless its for a flight duration of no more than 2 hours. Most passengers I spoke to by the end of the flight were also having back aches too. The flight also run out of wine and beer before they had completed serving the lunch so inflight service also very poor indeed. The sound on the entertainment system was also poor and the earphones kept falling out of your ears.    Singapore to Manchester. Very poor service in business class. I have flown SQ business class many times before but this is the first time I have experienced such terrible service. Was particularly disappointed with the food and beverage service, and availability of cabin crew. I had requested Thai chicken curry and rice for supper, but changed my mind and requested the FA to wake me up for breakfast. I woke up just as they were serving breakfast and I requested breakfast. About 20 min later, one of the FAs served my the Thai chicken curry and rice. I was a bit shocked and told her that I requested breakfast, not supper, to which she replied they can serve only one meal to pax, and since I hadnt eaten this for supper, they brought it to me for breakfast. What? Only one meal in business class on a 13h 30m flight? And they say normal breakfast (you know toast, cereals and orange juice) is not available? Absolutely ridiculous. Not acceptable, especially in business class. Also, once they served supper (or breakfast), they went into the galley/crew rest area and never came out, and during the entire 13h 30m journey they did not even offer water to any of the pax. Again, this is not acceptable, not anywhere, let alone business class. Extremely disappointed with SQ, really did not expect them to be so lax. Will be flying the competition from now on, they just lost a customer."
