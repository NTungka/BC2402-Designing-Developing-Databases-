Pre-COVID, "Mumbai to Singapore. Great Flight, departed/arrived on time. Excellent service. The hard product was the older seat which was significantly worse than the newer ones. This is because the A330s will be retired soon and replaced with Boeing 787 and A350s. I would advise that if possible you catch the A380 flight which leaves around the same time as it would be a better choice in my opinion especially if travelling in business class. Paid roughly 470 SGD for a return ticket which is a great price.   I cannot believe that this flight was the exact opposite of my last flight on SIA, when I went to the Philippines to see my daughter. Absolutely dreadful. This was a typical red eye flight, and Im at least 90% sure that SIA had reduced the leg pitch on this aircraft. Granted, I am 194cms tall, and that does not help the situation at all, but still, there were a number of things that were wrong on this flight. There was a gent in front of me who decided that he wanted to recline his seat back into me to the full extent, during taxi - it was ignored by the cabin crew. And it stayed like this for the remainder of the flight to Perth. I was served a meal by cabin crew with my tray table firmly poking into my chest. Not a single word was said to this gentleman in front of me by staff. Thank God we landed in Perth on time, I felt like I had to unravel my body to get off the plane. The passenger in question was only asked to move his seat upright about ten minutes prior to landing at Perth airport. In fairness, prior to writing this, I had written an email of my concerns to the airline. I was met with a we dont care kind of convoluted reply, probably from somebody who knows nothing about aircraft. I will be returning to Cebu to see my daughter at least two more times this year, but I will definitely not be flying SIA. I will revoke my KrisFlyer membership as well. I have flown budget airlines that are better than this. Buyer, beware! I would not recommend.   Hanoi to Cape Town via Singapore. I was very dissapointed with the way things were handled on 3 March 2019 before the flight, I was unable to board my flight, I let Singapore Airlines know via email, also tried calling but was unable to get through. I had to wait until Monday for anyone to help me and then got charged for a new flight ($584) due to missing the flight the day prior, even though I had notified the airline 6 hours before flight that I was going to miss it due to my Visa approval not arriving on time. Having paid this amount along with penalties for missing my previous flight has left me in a difficult financial situation so Im not impressed.  Frankfurt to Singapore. I have flown a couple of times with Singapore Airlines in the last two years and every time it is been a perfect experience due the staff and service offered on the plane. I have not me such dedicated and hard-working attendants on any other airline than in Singapore Airlines, as well as the quality of the food offered on their business class flights. The same great experience, as always, was on my last flight. I was also very happy with the service at check-in that is perfectly smooth and efficient.  Singapore to Hong Kong. Singapore Airlines is usually my familys airline choice because of the great service, seats and special assistance (I travel with a wheelchair with a Yamaha motor and battery). Checking in going to Hong Kong and leaving took a while due to the staff being unfamiliar with the chair. The check in staff going did not not pass information to the gate agent was asked the same questions again. When we landed in Hong Kong, the wheelchair had a bit of damage but was settled by the ground staff. Upon return, we were told to wait somewhere for the wheelchair but it turned out to be at baggage reclaim. Both flights were very good despite the issues on the ground which I wouldnt blame Singapore airlines for. The cabin pressure on the A350 was minimal compared to other aircraft. If you need special assistance traveling I would recommend flying on Singapore airlines.  London to Perth via Singapore. Having flown with Singapore before I was sure that they would be helpful and accomodating as we flew with our 5 month old to visit family at Christmas. We checked in the pram and car seat after paying to have them wrapped at the airport and had arranged to have a bassinet seat for the flight. This was all arranged with no problems. However, around an hour into the flight I was very aware that my baby needed to be changed. I went to queue for the toilets and there was 6 people ahead of me in the queue. My baby began to scream, IÆ’??m sure to the discomfort of the other passengers. I was very aware of this and decided to try and find another bathroom with a smaller queue. The only one with no queue and a change table was in business class. As I approached, one of the cabin staff asked where I was going. I said sorry, my baby is screaming I just need to change her she said you canÆ’??t use these toilets you have to go back I explained the queue situation but she wouldnÆ’??t budge so I had to go and queue with my child screaming and all the other passengers glaring at me. When we arrived at Perth airport we were annoyed to find that out pram was broken. Despite having it wrapped, it had been broken through the wrapping and the footrest was hanging off despite the fact we had only had it for 5 months. I checked the airline policies which stated we were covered up to a certain amount so I emailed them within 48 hours with the relevant forms, photos of damage, boarding passes and purchase receipts. They responded after a few days with a very unprofessional email basically requesting the same information I had already sent. I sent it again. Twice. They sent another badly worded email asking me to drop it off somewhere for assessment. By this point we had been back with our taped up pram for about two weeks. I responded explaining that itÆ’??s the only pram we have and we couldnÆ’??t drop it off. We had done everything they had asked. I never heard anything back. We were very disappointed and annoyed with the way we were treated both on the flight and the way our complaint was dealt with. I would never fly with Singapore airlines again which is a shame because I had flown with them twice previously (without an infant) and had a very positive experience.   Manila to Dubai via Singapore. This flight was better compared to my DXB-MNL experience. Crew were genuinely friendly. Greeting and talking to you with smile. They offered beverage options several times. Food was ok though. I was still looking forward to their IFE. Great option to save a playlist. Seat was comfortable. Not a fan of their 3-3-3 seat configuration but I was able to select a window seat at the last row of the mid section with only 2 seats. Big plus factor to the overall experience is the Singapore Changi Airport.   Singapore to Los Angeles via Tokyo vv on SQ012 and SQ011. Both flights are operated by Boeing 777-300ER. Both trips check in was quite fast and efficient, the staff was very helpful. The cabin crew was kind and helpful. The entertainment system has good content and responsive touch screen. The food was good. Overall, it was a pleasant experience for me.   I would like to express my gratitude for the superb service we received on our recent flight from Los Angeles to Mumbai via Singapore. We are two seasoned travellers, both very accustomed to long-haul routes. The A350 is a superb bird! It has to be said that the service provided in all four of the legs with Singapore Airlines was exceptional, from beginning to end (both on the ground and airborne); all staff where extremely professional, yet fun, friendly and accommodating to all passengers needs. This cabin crew in particular who looked after us on the long, SQ37 flight from LAX to SIN on 14/03/2019, provided beyond exceptional service. They were actively and consistently attending passengers requests, as well as checking that we were happy and well looked after, for what appeared to be the whole duration of the flight, or about 17+ hours. It was so satisfying and reassuring to see the dedication that this particular team had for their duties, as well as a clear love of the job. Great ambassadors for such well regarded airline such as SQ. We just simply couldnt had hoped for a more enjoyable journey. It is now clear to us that Singapore Airlines deserves to be the worlds best airline. We are truly looking forward to our next Singapore Airlines journey, which we hope will take place in the near future - this new experience in air travel has opened a new and fascinating window in our holidays.   Melbourne to Beijing via Singapore. After long journey, when I go to collect my baggage, it was not send on the plane which I travel. Baggage claim division at Beijing Airport inform my baggage will be arrived in next available flight. My destination is another city which I want to get a domestic flight. From there, I have to go to my hotel on yuan 150 taxi. They advised me to collect my baggage from that airport when it arrives. Till, then they offer me yuan 400 (around 90 AUD to cover all damages which include buying temporary clothes. Thanks for letting down me as a long-standing Singapore traveller.   Singapore to Manila. Automated check-in is quite efficient. Service as usual is exceptional as the crew were attentive to the needs of the passengers. Great ambiance inside the aircraft and the food was great.   Singapore to Perth. The Singapore Airlines Boeing 787-10 is a first class plane and comes with excellent and attentive service from the cabin crew. Very modern Kris entertainment system. Food acceptable but not fantastic. Suggest they provide headsets rather than the earpiece variety which are hopeless.   Singapore to Sydney. Very comfortable flight as the aircraft was not full. Excellent cabin staff and amazing inflight entertainment options. Food however was a major disappointment. Ordered the fish with dill sauce and apart from the the mashed potato, it was flavourless. The pizza snack served before landing was terrible stodgy. Wine options were either a very poor white or an even rougher red. I cant understand how Singapore can get everything else so right and the food so wrong.   Singapore to London Heathrow. For my holiday to New Zealand in February / March this year I decided to upgrade my flights for all four legs of the journey to business class. Three parts of my journey were enjoyable, the service and food was good, even though I didnt receive the book the cook meals Id ordered. Sadly on the last leg from Singapore to London flight SQ322 I found myself on the A380-800. I found the business class section to be cramped, with a lack of storage space, not very well designed and for a new plane starting to show signs of wear and tear. The first problem was the width of the seat, it was a lot narrower than other seats in business class. I heard a lady behind me complaining to a stewardess about the hard seat. She replied that BMW had designed it. My thought was what is comfortable in a sports car is not so good on a 13-15 hour flight where you are sitting / lying down for nearly all the time. However with cushions it can be made more comfortable. Nothing can be done to make the seat wider and the high and very wide plastic infill between my seat and the window made me feel more cramped. I could see no useful purpose for it. The lack of storage space was a problem. I didnt want to put my carry on bag in the overhead lockers as it could be difficult / noisy to access it on a night flight. Unlike some other planes there was no small recess area where I could put my bag on the floor, but within my seating area, so the aisle was still clear. A stewardess put it on the floor but when the bed was out I couldnt access it without grovelling about on the floor. I made my bed up and tried to sleep. I placed my handbag on top of the large but fairly useless plastic infill, during the flight I think as a result of turbulence the bag fell on my head. I wasnt impressed at the time but later on I did see the funny side of it. As the seat / bed was narrow when I turned over I kept hitting my head. It was also quite difficult to get up from. Ive had no such difficulties on other business class flights . The design, space and attractiveness is so much better on other Singapore Airlines business class cabins. I know the other passengers in my group flying in business on this flight were unhappy too. While I was queuing to leave the plane at the end of the flight a man of average height and regular weight said That thing is a waste of space refering to the plastic infill between the seat and the window. I had to agree. A senior stewardess told me the airline is planning to convert more of their planes to this design. Thanks for the warning. When I fly to Australia next year I will have to look for a new provider. I cant take the risk of paying for a business class fare and being placed on the A 380-800 again.  Singapore to Manila. Overall a very bad cabin experience. 24 Feb 2019 - SQ917 KrisWorld down for the entire cabin.  26 Feb 2019 - SQ916 KrisWorld still down. reflected that I had feedback a couple of days ago on the return leg from Manila. 28 Feb 2019 - SQ917 KrisWorld still down. Steward was very impatient to the passenger in front of me when asked about the status. Disappointed that my feedback in the last few flights on the same journey wasnt considered at all. 03 Mar 2019 - SQ5254 Preferred meal was forgotten. I had listed a preferred meal in my preference. 10 Mar 2019 - SQ957 Lead steward conveniently forgot about my request. In the end I did not get any meals on board.   London to Singapore. Singapore Airlines Book The Cook service in business class is excellent and I wish all airlines offered pre-booking for main meals. My Lobster Thermidor was delicious, the cheese board was well presented and the apricot and pumpkin puree with the scallops was divine. Their cabin crew are welcoming and friendly, well trained, attentive and very efficient. All with a quiet charm as they glide through the cabin. A great flight and I managed at least 6 hours of shut-eye before landing.   Perth to Singapore. Dirty tray table, bad cabin crew, poor special meal. During the day flight the window shades on empty seats were up and cabin crew were not bothered to pull them down and a couple of passengers went to do it themselves in front of the cabin crew who just started blankly and didnt do anything about the remaining blinds that were up. On the way to Perth from Singapore I was given the dessert despite being on the special meal but on the return flight, the steward proceeded to pass it to me but then retracted his arm back when he saw I was on the special meal, and no explanation was given. It was not any vegetarian meal as well but why is there no consistency? Worst thing was there was no explanation and he just walked away.   Dubai to Manila via Singapore. First time to fly with SQ. I have very high expectations based on reviews and awards. However, my experience was mixed. Food and IFE were great and amazing. Cabin crew always smiling although it sometimes felt mechanical. Simple kit was also provided. DXB-SIN, B777-300ER was great however SIN-MNL aircraft was old didnt even bother using the IFE. Food served was not clearly advised that one option was spicy. I liked the food however overheard another passenger who doesnt like spicy food said that she wished she was told that it was spicy. Had some interesting encounters with cabin crew. First, a cabin crew used his index finger to give instructions to me instead of open palm/hand. Another cabin crew, during beverage serving, gave me the remaining orange juice as if i have no choice to make. Although both were minor hiccups. One funny incident had me cheering silently for the cabin crew as one of the adult passenger (father of another young adult passenger) kept on answering from the opposite row on behalf of his son every time a cabin crew would ask his son thus making a bit of a minor noise/disturbance. Cabin crew reminded the adult passenger that his son is old enough to answer simple questions. Fierce, i liked it. Thats why im raising my overall experience score to 8 because of that.   This was my 5th experience with Singapore Airlines but very different than the other 4. We had our Mumbai to Singapore flight delayed by 5-6 hours and eventually the 2nd flight from Singapore to Melbourne too got delayed however by 8-9 hours. We were made to stay in Ramada Singapore where the lunch was not made available to us, dinner too was compromised. We had a terrible stay and food in the hotel. Overall, I would not rate my journey a pleasant one.   This was the first time my wife and I flew Singapore Airlines, what a wonderful experience! From check-in to deplaning everything went smoothly and on time. The cabin crew were superb. The service was attentive, food delicious, the cabin was attractive and very clean, including bathrooms. We flew United from Singapore to San Francisco, after our Singapore vacation, and the flight was no way near as good. Singapore Airlines will start flying direct from Seattle to Singapore non-stop in September 2019 and we definitely will use them when we visit Singapore again. P.S. We flew United on frequent flyer miles to India, and from Singapore to Seattle via San Francisco, Singapore Airlines is by far the best.   Older plane and business class seats are 2x2x2, so no wifi on board. However seats are comfortable and have a good recline, which is not bad for the short flight from Singapore to Perth. Meals are fantastic, especially as we booked the cook - the assam fish was one of the best I have ever had. Entertainment selection is decent and inflight shopping selection is wide. Best of all, service is impeccable.    Amsterdam to Singapore. Singapore Airlines has the best service. Wide selection of inflight shopping. Food is fantastic. We had satay before our appetizer and it was as close as you can get in a satay stall without charcoal. A good range of new movies with the new month. The best thing about AMS to SG is the skybed, which gave us some decent sleep ahead of arriving in SG. Unfortunately, there was limited stock of sake. I had one and there was none left!! Wifi was good when available - the 30MB gets chewed up very quickly! Nevertheless, this is a fantastic airline and we will definitely fly again as our airline of choice.
   Flew Singapore Airlines from Singapore to London Heathrow. The cabin crew on this flight worked tirelessly to keep the passengers comfortable. They were smart, professional and extremely personable. Id have liked it to have been warmer on board, still feeling cold even with a down jacket on. The plane now seems a bit tired with a couple of screens not working and a head rest which wouldnt stay up. I too would like to see considerably less plastic used.   Singapore to Hanoi. Although the service was great, I found the amount of plastic wasted horrifying. Everything was wrapped in plastic. There was even a plastic cup to put your water that was contained in a plastic cup. Wouldnt fly with Singapore again.   Singapore Airlines has impressed me on the Singapore-Sydney route for the first time. It is evident that the morning flights are much better than the night time flights. As SQ 211 departed, a great lunch was served followed by multiple drink rounds before a mini pizza prior to landing, which compares well against the red eye SQ221 and 231. The staff were quite courteous with the exception of one cabin crew member, the rest were extremely pleasant. Specially the leading crew in charge was particularly friendly. Flight landed ahead of schedule and all in all, I couldnt fault the service.   London to Singapore. Easy boarding with punctual push back and arrival. Latest seats Æ’?? I loved the wrap-round screen for the seat, almost like some other airlines first class. The steward had to put my bed down for me and I found it rather hard for sleeping on. IFE was not really 5* standard. Food and service were excellent throughout. Overall, a very high standard throughout.   San Francisco to Bangalore via Singapore. I have flown Singapore Airlines from the past 20 years regularly until now, I considered myself to be a loyal customers. They used to care about customers before; apparently, being named the best airline in the world has gone to their head and they think they no longer have to satisfy their customers. I flew Premium economy recently to Bangalore and paid for the extra legroom seat--the flight was ordinary. I was expecting an offer to upgrade to business class before my flight and I have more than 50,000 pts. No such offer came--I tried to offer a bid, the system didnt allow me to. When I saw the flight, there were plenty of seats empty in Business class. Not sure why they dont want to offer the premium economy passengers to upgrade to business. Warning to everyone travelling from SFO--some connections to India have a very short layover--less than an hour. SA doesnt have any consideration that if the landing is a few minutes late and the connecting flight is within 30 minutes, they shouldnt make the passenger run from one terminal to another even using Skytrain. I barely made it before the gate closed (with my bad knees). Remember, you have to go through security in Singapore when you have a connecting flight. I had to rush from Terminal B to C with no time even to rush to the restroom let alone freshen up. While returning from Bangalore, I had ~4 kgs extra. Instead of asking me to pay using my Krisflyer (over 50,000) points, Singapore airlines charged me for a whole extra piece. So watch out, even if you are just 2-4 kgs over the limit in Premium economy, they will charge the cost of a suitcase. I even asked to pay for the upgrade in Bangalore, the said I cant do it in the last minute using points and I should check during my layover in Singapore (~ 2 hours). When I tried to upgrade for the longer flight SIN - SFO, they said that I dont have enough points. I offered to pay with points and cash--they said I cant do that. They just didnt want me in Business class even with points or cash! I wanted to avoid paying extra weight fees as I would have below the limit int Business class. If this is not an example of not caring for customers or accommodating its Krisflyer members, I dont know what is. Why cant they charge per Kg extra weight instead of an additional piece of luggage like other airlines?  Flight and food was ordinary (food quality has declined from SF to Singapore), and the bathroom cleanliness both ways was not up to par like it used to be. Changi airport is exceptional of course. I am not sure I will be flying this airline again while there are so many carriers who offer upgrades for a reasonable price and cheaper tickets. Not sure what to do with the balance points (more than 50,000 points) though. Sorry Singapore airlines, you lost a loyal flyer who has flow the long route for more than 20 years..   Singapore to Tokyo. The flight was fully packed, but we still manage to fly on time and reach there slightly earlier than scheduled. I flew with friends and took a row of seat. We  accidentally spilled a drink, and the stewardess was  smiling as they help us clean the mess, they also keep coming back to us to check if our seats are dry, giving us extra napkins and later, extra blankets telling us to sit on it. What a pleasant experience. In flight entertainment was great, plenty of choices, and movies from all over the world. One thing though, we found the leg space to be slightly smaller than usual, not sure if it was all the winter clothing we had with us, or the seat space shrunk. We chose different meals, and tried each others, they taste great.    Bangkok to Dusseldorf via Singapore. During meal service SQ flight BKK- SIN and SIN-DUS I requested hot tea with lemon and coke. Flight attendant did not pay attention then gave me a salad sauce instead of coke and tea lemon. I was hocked and repeated my request for hot tea with lemon and coke. Flight attendant politely smiled and skipped my request. Dinner meal was without any dessert on international flight SIN-DUS. I was surprised there is no dessert. I asked crew  and they said no dessert and no fruits. During snack service they offered only mini potato chips and mini ice cream. There is poor meal quality on international flights and Singapore Airlines crew members were not attentive just poor attention and performed poor sloppy service.  Poor WIFI connection. Awful! Bad experience.    Singapore to Denpasar Bali. Early morning departure from SIN at Chinese New Year, so it was a pretty full flight. Just after security check and with less than one hour to departure, we were told that there was a technical problem with the plane and we needed to switch plane (different gate). Amazingly, the entire flight was only delayed by 1 hour, which given the short notice, I feel is pretty amazing. Flight was on A330, which has the 2-4-2 configuration, and as usual, I opted for the (2) seat which I increasingly like. Seats were slightly narrower than the B777, but it just feels less cramped than the 3 seat options. Flight crew were slightly less charming than usual, but I guess the last minute change probably had something to do with this, and they still dealt very politely with some very demanding customers. Food was reasonably good (had Indonesian option), and IFE was as standard on the A330, if slightly dated. Only slight downside was the toilet, which although clean, had obviously seen better days with some wear and tear. So a good economy experience and I guess the additional cost for the flight (as opposed to the budget airline) pays off when something does wrong, as the recovery was really fast.  Service is unparalleled. Food is very good and served on proper plates with real cutlery. Wide selection of online shopping. Best thing about this flight was the sky bed. The chair unfolds into a flat bed, which gave my son and I some decent sleep. The plane leaves SG just before midnight and arrives in AMS around 6.15am - so even a 12 hour flight seems like no time is wasted. Wifi is available on board but requires payment. The complimentary allowance for business class members is only suited for text messages - runs out fast.  Overall, a very comfortable flight. Will definitely fly again.   Singapore to New York. The entertainment center/movies were superb, although some of the plug connections were older, so the voice is low.  One time, the flight was making a loud bothering noise, and we were concerned about it especially during take off. The next flight was delayed, they decided to replace the airplane. I appreciate it that they put safety before anything else. The food was satisfying. The attendants smile. They worked fast in getting what the customers need. They are always ready to answer calls.    Perth to Singapore. Outstanding service. In flight shopping has a huge selection of quality products. Book the cook menu was impressive - lobster thermidor and my sons steak were cooked to perfection. The selection of beverages was fantastic. Entertainment selection is not bad. This is an older plane, so unfortunately my seat could not lie flat and my sons screen was slightly damaged. Nevertheless, seats are still comfortable for the short flight from Perth to Singapore.  Singapore to Milan with Singapore Airlines. A generally excellent airline with great cabin crew and great food. The seat was very comfortable for my 12hr and 30min flight and it really changed the way I feel of flying!   Melbourne to Jakarta via Singapore. My wife and I flew Singapore Air for first time and were very impressed. Economy seats the best weÆ’??ve had (and we travel a lot). Food and beverage service good and cabin crew were very efficient. Very good selection for inflight entertainment system. Highly recommended.   Singapore to Denpasar. Having experienced Uniteds version of the B787, this was an opportunity to revisit the experience on SQ instead on a short 2.5 hour flight. The initial entrance into the economy cabin is certainly more welcoming than Uniteds experience. Once seated, you notice the high-density, thin seat cushions, which give you more perceived legroom than the standard 32 in pitch would suggest. Because SQ stayed with the 3-3-3 configuration, the seat width is narrower than the comparable A330 or B777 experience, and I certainly felt this was the case, despite the very narrow armrests. Certainly the aisles are narrow, and in the aisle seat, I was constantly jostled by passengers and assorted bags during the boarding process. I also found it hard to get comfortable on the thinner seats, though this was less of an issue for a short-haul flight. The IFE was a class above Uniteds, with a large vibrant touchscreen and the newest KrisWorld experience (minus the seat controller), so all interactions are via the screen. Meals were reasonably good if not outstanding, while service on the inbound flight to SG was warm and friendly.  I wish that cabin seat space for Economy passengers could be maintained, given that the vast majority of us travel this way.  Kuala Lumpur to Cape Town via Singapore. As usual, they are famous of their top notch quality, service, and efficiency. Crews were very attentive and helpful. Upon boarding the aircraft, you could already feel their warmth hospitality. Food is good and IFE is fantastic. Cabin crew go around with drinks and snacks in the mid of flight very frequent (every 20 mins) which is hardly seen on the other major airlines. Its definitely worth it for the price I pay for. I will choose to fly with SIA again.   Cape Town to Singapore via Johannesburg. Friendly crew and fantastic service. The flight was 98% pax loading and cabin crew were really busy attending to passengers needs. However, they remained professional and attentive. They are so nice and friendly. New aircraft, nice inflight entertainment system, delicious food, ample amenities in the toilets. Will definitely fly with them again.   Wellington to Mumbai via Melbourne / Singapore. What can I say about this airline Æ’?? always has been my favourite and always will be. Everything from check-in, boarding, IFE, meals, baggage Æ’?? went smoothly. Cabin crew were as gracious as usual. Would definitely recommend. Only perk: this was somewhat an expensive ticket (but I would definitely pay the extra and fly SQ, than other airlines that fly the route), Singapore Airlines can definitely work on competitive pricing.   Singapore to Denpasar. Poor flight. Average food. No pillows available at the economy cabin. Old aircraft. Seats at the vertical position very uncomfortable. Ground service unpolite.

   
Singapore to Zurich is operated by an A380. This particular A380 that I was on is 6 years old and had the old business class product. The seat is very wide - the widest Business Class seat for any airline - sufficient to squeeze 2 slim Asians into the seat. To convert to bed mode, passengers had to pull down the seat back and raise the footrest. Because the footwell is located to one side, passengers have to sleep in a diagonal fashion. I ordered the lobster thermidor from Book the Cook. It was delicious. Cabin crew were very friendly and polite and addressed passengers by family name. After supper, it was time to sleep. A flight attendant deployed the bed for me and I had an uninterrupted 7 hours of sleep before breakfast. For breakfast I chose the Nasi Briyani, an aromatic Indian dish. Even at cruising altitude, the flavours and aroma of the dish was well preserved. I highly recommend the SIA Business Class - best in its category.   Rome to Singapore. This was my first time on the A350. It was a rather empty flight from Rome to Singapore. The business class featured the new business class product where there were buttons to control the decline of the seat. However, to convert to bed mode, you will need a flight attendant to pull down the seat back from the upright position. This is the main bugbear of the Business Class seat. No amenity kit is provided on SQ business class but you can find toothbrush, shaving kit, comb, moisturiser and hand cream in the toilet. Only eye mask, socks and slippers are provided for long haul flights. On this route , I had the Milanese Osso Bucco for my lunch main course and it was delicious. Breakfast was served 90 minutes before arrival into Singapore and I had the Westerm option of sausage, mushrooms and omelette with corn flakes and fruits. As with other Singapore Airlines flights, the cabin crew were very polite, gracious and helpful and were able to anticipate passengersÆ’?? needs. Singapore Airlines Business Class is the best in the category. Wifi was available on this flight. For business class passengers, the first 30 MB is free and after that you can purchase additional MB depending on your needs up to 200MB for US$ 25. The connection speed was reasonably fast - sufficient to upload a few Facebook photos.   Singapore to Hanoi. This was for sure the best flight we ever had! Starting with the food: as vegetetarians we were offered a wide range of delicious Asian dishes. The portions were large, we got 2 starters, one main, 2 desserts plus snacks on a only 2 h 30min flight. Furthermore the cabin crew was outstandingly attentive, polite and friendly. We were on the flight SQ188 from Singapore to Hanoi on 25/01/19. Thank you to the crew once more for this pleasant experience!   Travelled from Singapore to Auckland on the 10.25pm flight. Service aboard the flight was excellent. On arrival in Auckland passengers had to disembark by way of mobile stairs. I have to say, while being advised to mind our step as we stepped onto the swaying stairway, due to wind gusts, I noticed there was only one staff member that was there to help with passengers, which I felt was a small let down due to the fact it was a full flight. However, the staff that was helping passengers was absolutely amazing.    San Francisco to Dhaka via Singapore. Very poor online and customer service. I had a hard time selecting seats online even though I paid for seat selection. I had to call customer service 7 times to get my seats. Even after paying and calling 7 times, the selected seats never showed up on itinerary or booking making me worry util I check in and board the plane.    Sydney to Singapore. Biggest standout which are most important to me. Service -staff have excellent communication are very proactive, thoughtful and attentive to your needs. The flight was very smooth with the pilots communication being very clear. Food: excellent without being flamboyant.   Paris to Brisbane via Singapore. Spent the extra to go Premium Economy. While the flight to Paris from Brisbane was relatively enjoyable, the return was not. The staff serving our aisle constantly forgot things. I was given half a meal (no diet restrictions) she just forgot to give the rest. When I realised because the woman across from me received her full meal (from the FA on the other aisle). I asked my FA for the rest. She said she would have to check if she had any left. She then proceeded to serve the rest of her side of the plane and then forgot entirely. When I pressed the service button, she came up and told me I had bumped it before even asking if I needed anything. I reminded her about the meal but she said they had all gone. I ended up with an economy meal then - no choice. My partner numerous times requested a drink and had to remind the woman 15 minutes later when nothing came. Then to top it off - For Christmas my partner purchased a new suitcase for me. So the return trip was its first time. It was a Samsonite Case and it arrived in Brisbane completely trashed. Plastic parts around the handle snapped off, dents so large it pierced the plastic the whole way through. My zip doesnt even zip up flush to the case any longer. I contacted the airline but they will not cover it.    Singapore Airlines is a totally different airline when taking the route Singapore to Stockholm via Moscow. The air hostesses are usually very service minded in Singapore Airlines and thats why I used to like them. But the exception is this flight through Russia. The air hostesses are mainly Russian and do not meet expectations in my eyes of the usual level of service that defines this airline. Furthermore, when exiting the plane in Moscow, prepare yourself for a nightmare. 1 long line which consists of all the passengers on the A350-900, needs to line up for getting a red stamp in your boarding pass. Then you have to stand in a second long line to get a green stamp in your boarding pass. Then there was a third line to the x-ray of the hand luggage before you could stand (not enough seats to sit) by the gate without any restaurant, caf?? or what so ever. And add to the misery that since i stupidly enough forgot my boarding pass to Moscow on the plane, I had to stand in a fourth line. Its very obvious this route is a failure. It is always way more cheap going through DME to and from Singapore than through LHR, FRA or CPH. Avoid Singapore Airlines flying to and from Stockholm through Moscow.   Wellington to Singapore. My trip was quite disappointing, the 777 aircraft are so old! The TV screen resolution is horrible. Entertainment options not the newest. The flight was delayed by almost 2 hours because of push back issues.  Service and food was just okay; nothing memorable.  With the high prices they charge, I dont think its worth it, but I still love the brand.  As Bi-annual visitors to Thailand, by recommendation, we went with SQ for a change having heard great things about Changi airport. This time we took our adult daughter too - the shopper. Unfortunately, all we saw of Changi was what we saw while running through the terminal, owing to our first connecting flight being delayed, then our second going tek and requiring us to change aircraft many hours later than our departure time. We were handed forms at the departure gate and an invitation to contact Singapore Airlines for future incentives. Infact, what we got in reply, months later, was in short: Safety first; we dont compensate for delays or connections - if missed (all our flights were SQ). Tough luck. Therefore our experience of SQ is one we wouldnt recommend and as they state, they wash their hands of you if you miss a connection even in the event that connecting flights are both SQ. As a former employee of a British airline operating the very same aircraft I feel I have enough experience to say this is at best a poor outcome from SQ. On a positive note, they make it easy to decide who not to spend your time airborne with. Also, my wife is gluten free, although requested, she had to skip some meals because they didnt have the gf option for her.   London Heathrow to Sydney via Singapore. Both myself and my wife enjoyed the overall experience, responsive flight attendants and very friendly. Our only real complaint is the food which we found to be rather unappetising and repetitive, perhaps a few European or English dishes would be a refreshing change and certainly more welcoming to our palate.   Paris to Singapore return in seat 41B (seat with more space against extra fee). Service remains 5-star, food, onboard service and entertainment, boarding. Have flown several times on this airline in the past in economy class. Boarding on both flights were swift and smooth with clear instructions from airline staff. Choice of food adequate with sandwiches/refreshment available outside of main meal distribution. On the return leg, the breakfast offering was adequate but not available due to short supply on board. I was forced to take noodles as breakfast while preference was for other dish. Boeing 777 seats are of good quality, only drawback is that seat cushion is quite short for a tall person with long legs and the screen is slightly far away from the seat. Movie offering is very extended with quite some recent movies in different languages. (A380 is more comfortable). Seats 41A & B are best, avoid 41C which passenger was hit all the time by transiting galleys As usual Changi airport is fabulous airport even with a transit time of 4 hours with next connection: gardens, swimming pool, butterfly and movie area is unique, European airports should learn and copy.   Aircraft was very outdated. Inflight entertainment audio was out of sync with the screen.  I order a diabetic meal and the meals I was due on this flight never came with a drink until the main service was undertaken. The last meal I was asked if I wanted tea or coffee; I replied water and it never arrived. Others were at least 40 minutes after I had finished my meal.   Service and airline were excellent. IÆ’??ve flown with most international airlines and Singapore Airlines is easily the best. They looked after us during the entire flight. Easy check in process etc. Flew London to Singapore to Melbourne in economy class.  Another great flight from Singapore to London. Me and my wife were sat in the upper economy deck which was great! The seats were really comfortable and the service was just as good as my last trip. The food was really good and a great selection of films. IÆ’??m so glad IÆ’??ve booked with Singapore Airlines for my next long haul trip.   Sydney to London via Singapore. The seats in business class are awkward, to use the lie flat seat it is necessary to lie at an angle, and because of this it feels cramped. We left Sydney at 7.05 in the evening, and had the on board meal at approximately 8.00 pm, there was a choice and it was perfectly adequate. The flight to Singapore takes 7.15 hrs, there was a 1 hour change over of planes. After take off we were offered dinner again, which having already had an evening meal I passed. The flight to London from Singapore takes 14 hrs 35 mins. Breakfast is not available until 2 hrs before landing. It was served very late. I think the stewards should be aware of passengers who have been on the flights for 22-23 hrs, and be prepared to offer breakfast much earlier. We will not be travelling Singapore airlines again.   San Francisco to Bangalore via Singapore. I have been flying Singapore Airlines for the past thirty years. I have noticed a visible degradation in the quality of service over the years.  Ever since the introduction of the Premium Economy class, the quality of the service in the economy class has declined. The flight attendants go about their tasks mechanically, with little or no interaction with passengers. The food is mostly inedible. During my most recent flight, I opted for the Dim Sum breakfast between Hong Kong and San Francisco. The soggy, mushy items had no resemblance to Dim Sum items I have had anywhere. While US airlines such as Delta and United have vastly improved service for economy travelers, Singapore appears to be goading their economy passengers to upgrade to the significantly more expensive Premium Economy class. However, it is very hard for me to justify spending an additional $1000 just to get two upgraded meals and a slightly larger TV screen.   Frankfurt to Singapore. The flight attendants are some of the nit-pickiest Ive ever seen. My crime was sleeping during the pre-flight video. The experience was no better than average. The food wasnt special, the premium economy seat was a premium economy seat. It got worse on the way back when we stopped at the Star Gold lounge to discover what is the worse Gold lounge Ive ever been to. It felt more like a private waiting area than a lounge, it doesnt even have its own bathrooms. Singapore is doing the bare minimum to provide the benefits as part of Star Alliance.  Lufthansa gained a star - maybe Singapore needs to lose one.  Flew Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Bandar Seri Begawan. As usual, excellent service onboard. Very professional service crew and very courteous and helpful. Saw many of them helping passengers with their requests such as blankets, baggage, newspapers. The food is also good and sufficient. The choice of movies were great though I wished the plane was equipped with the newer wider screens.  First time flying on the A350 and it makes the flight from Munich to Singapore considerably more comfortable than on the 777. As usual Singapore Airlines staff were friendly and professional, as we were traveling with a toddler, we were invited to board first and get ourselves settled. Stewardess came by to check if we needed anything for our daughter and if we would like our meals at different times. Seats were comfortable, row 41, which has the advantage of lots of leg room but has fixed armrests which hems you in a bit. There is an extensive selection of movies which will keep most people entertained for a flight longer than the 11 hours we had. SQ is saving money a bit with the food portions getting smaller but flavour and quality were still there. A350 is quiet and the lower cabin preasure is noticeable in that you arrived refreshed even after the long flight, I even managed a few hours sleep. Flight departed a bit late but arrived 30 min ahead of schedule. Once again Singapore Airlines is a great way to fly.  Johannesburg to Shanghai via Singapore. I always travel business class (though first time on SIA fleet) and conclude that Singapore Airlines is the best. The aircraft are up to date and so are the facilities. Neat, clean and comfortable. But, it is the staff that take the airline to the next level - courteous, friendly, helpful and efficient especially the cabin crew on flights SQ 479, JHB to Singapore, 10 Feb and SQ 478, Shanghai to Singapore, 28 Feb 2018.   Melbourne to Singapore leg flown on Boeing 777 with outdated cabin.  Seat was hard and thin, food  of average quality. Cabin staff spoke quietly. Return flight was on a Boeing 777 with newer cabin. Seats were excellent, they fold down from the back so the bed is on the back of the seat. A bit of fussing around to set it up but super comfortable and very wide. But it needs to be wide as someone 181cm tall still needs to lie on an angle, as the foot cubby-hole is not in line with the seat centre-line.   Flew London Heathrow to Singapore. First time I have flown with Singapore Airlines and it was an eye opener. The staff are actually genuinely friendly and the service and products are excellent. Lots of legroom, great entertainment and really good food and drinks. During the flight they kept coming round with more drinks and more food offerings. Great flight and will fly with them again.   Singapore to Jakarta. Another short haul and nothing to complain about services and foods. It  meets a standard of 5 star airlines (whether the aircraft is old), combining a with very nice airport at Changi. My favourite as always, nice job Singapore Airlines.  Flew Perth to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Check in was quick and smooth. The boarding was orderly and the crew greeted the passengers with a smile. Found a pillow and blanket on my seat. The seat and leg room was average. No footrests but liked the flexible adjustable headrests. Flight left only a few minutes late from the scheduled take off. Shortly after take off the crew came out with hot towels, snacks, drinks and food menu. There were enough alcoholic drinks to choose from. I got myself a Tiger beer but I had to ask for second beer, would have preferred if the crew had offered. Food was fresh and tasted great, didnt taste like airline food at all. There was salmon with coleslaw, crackers and cheese, bread roll and butter along with 2 choices of main course. My Asian beef curry was delicious. For dessert we had fresh fruit salad and gelato. The best meal I have had on a flight and this was all in economy class. The let down was the IFE. The screens were small and had poor resolution, no touchscreen either. The headphone jack was fiddly, I was using my personal headphones but occasionally I would lose sound in either left or right channel. I watched Dunkirk (2017), which was good. On arrival the luggage arrived quickly and without any damage. Overall a good flight but was disappointed with IFE. The ticket was also expensive compared with other airlines.   San Francisco to Singapore. My wife and I were planning a vacation to SE Asia, so I bought round-trip tickets between San Francisco and Singapore on the Singapore Airlines web site. The next day I was looking for tickets to Siem Reap for a side trip to Angkor Wat when I discovered on Travelocity that Silk Air had the best flights, and that Silk Air was a part of Singapore Airlines. Singapore Airlines website did not make this clear at all. So I called Singapore Airlines to add these Silk Air flights to my booking. Imagine my surprise and disbelief when I was told I had to pay a $500 penalty because this Æ’??changeÆ’?? came two hours after their 24 hour change deadline. I talked to two of their supervisors, but they also insisted on this penalty. It did not matter that Silk Air was hidden deep within Singapore Airlines website. It did not matter that I was adding Singapore Airline flights to my itinerary. It did not matter that I was only 2 hours past their 24 hour Æ’??deadlineÆ’?? Since my Singapore Airlines flights were non-refundable I had no choice but to pay the $500 penalty. Just booking the Silk Air flights separately would have cost me an extra $690. In a situation that clearly called for a little flexibility and compromise Singapore Airlines showed none. For that reason they have earned my lowest rating.   Jakarta to Singapore. This time I took an economy class since the flight was short haul. As always theyÆ’??re really good from ground handling until services during the flight. Nothing to say again about this airline since I only choose them and SilkAir for Southeast AsiaÆ’??s destination.   Kuala Lumpur to Singapore. ItÆ’??s still good and worthy for 45mins flight. They couldnÆ’??t serve meal but itÆ’??s acceptable since the flight is very short and the drink was quite good and definitely choose SIA again and thereÆ’??s no regret at all for this very short trip. Thanks SIA.   Coimbatore to Melbourne via Singapore. I travelled with my 16 month old baby and SIA did not offer me a bassinet seat although I had requested for it before hand. They said that they have children younger than mine who needed it. I understand that but they should have offered me a spare seat or upgraded me to business class. I had to travel from Singapore to Melbourne with not enough leg room. On top of it the cabin crew didnt bother to provide any food for the baby. They didnt offer me an infant seat belt (I had to insist on one). Singapore airlines is not cheap and we pay the extra money for a comfortable travel. I have been flying Singapore airlines for the past 10 years and this has been the worst travel ever.   Flew Singapore Airlines from Singapore to Auckland. Disappointed firstly we were only given one glass of champagne, not duplicates as advertised. Secondly we chose meals via Book the Chef and we had finished our meals before we were offered wine and then only a small glass supplied. We were offered no snacks and the curtain was drawn very quickly and passengers were quickly sent to the rear of the aircraft if they entered the curtain wall. This was in complete contrast to the flight from London to Singapore which was superb. We were offered champagne top up and crew could not be more helpful. Hope it improves on the return!   A380 from Singapore to Sydney. Aircraft was up to standard and leg room was adequate. Dinner was acceptable , breakfast was a let down as a muffin can hardly pass as a continental breakfast as the menu suggested. The strong point of the airline remains with the cabin crew who were extremely attentive and efficient right throughout.   Sydney to Singapore with the A380-800 was a pleasant experience.  Aircraft is fully equipped with the right entertainment and facilities for a long haul flight. The strong point of the airline remains with the cabin crew who did an efficient and friendly job managing the cabin. The catering however, was a major let down as there was no International option and the breakfast was merely a muffin, which is a pathetic excuse for what is marketed as a Æ’??continental breakfastÆ’??. Ground staff at both ends were remarkable.  We flew the 1250 flight from Singapore to London Heathrow. Push back on time but queuing on the taxiway for take off for another 25 mins before take off. The economy cabin was probably 60% full so we had 3 seats between the two of us. A few lucky travellers had 3 seats each so could get some reasonably comfortable sleep. The plane was clean. The set back TVs in excellent condition. The cabin temperature was just right too. Cabin crew very attentive and regularly came through the cabin with juices or water. The two meals were tasty as were the mid flight snacks of meat rolls, crisps and chocolate. As ecomony goes this has got to be one of the best offerings for long haul. However I would say that when the seat in front is reclined it is very intrusive into your personal space and makes watching your own TV screen uncomfortable. The only answers then for you too to recline your seat. If only everyone would just keep their seats upright! The outbound trip 3 weeks earlier was equally as comfortable. 5 stars all round!  London to Bangkok via Singapore. I dont know why Singapore Airlines chose a seat which needs a crew member to set it up before sleeping. If you want to recline the crew member again has to disable the sleep position. Sleeping at a angular position is not comfortable. Apart from this the crew were very attentive, caring and the quality of AVML was very good.  Flew Los Angeles to Tokyo Narita with Singapore Airlines. Pleasant Crew, food OK. Nice menu and small amenity kit. The crew seemed very nice and polite but a little robotic. No personalities. The food was ok, seats great because itÆ’??s still 9 across in Economy. Many other airlines are 10 across. Impossible to sleep due to the fact that the seat belt sign was turned on and off every 20 minutes and the captain and crew made really loud PAs. Now I understand that itÆ’??s a safety issue. Almost all other airlines have a faster seat belt message come up on your screen. By the 4th OA at 4 am I was ready to lose my cool. Also like other rules IÆ’??ve never experienced before with competing carries. I was told that because I was at the bulkhead, if there was turbulence IÆ’??d have to restore my back. I thought thatÆ’??s no going to happen. So all in all a nice airline but a lot of hype.   Manchester to Houston. Some hostesses were very brusque and at odds to the image this company likes to portray. On the return trip in particular, the cabin was only 1/4 full and the service was very rushed. There should be no reason for this on a 8.5 hour flight with a full complement of staff. There were a few ambitious types who tried to look like they were in charge of the others but I guess you get that sort everywhere. No individual air vents.   Chennai to Los Angeles via Singapore. I have been flying this route on Singapore Airlines for about 30 years. Although the overall level of service is good there has been a decline in passenger facilities and comfort. Their Business class lounge in Chennai is a joke with about 20 seats in a small enclosure resembling a neglected warehouse. The seats on the Singapore - Los Angeles segment are flat beds but they are difficult to operate. Most people needed assistance from the flight attendants to switch between the flat bed and regular seating positions. Meals are ok but nothing great. The in flight entertainment is below average. There is the annoying halt for just over an hour in Tokyo where all passengers have to disembark and go through security before re-boarding the aircraft. Overall Singapore Airlines will no longer be my first choice carrier unless they attend to these issues.   Guangzhou to Singapore with A330 aircraft. The timing of flight SQ851 is good for the people departing from Guangzhou and arrive in Singapore. The cabin crew are nice and some of them even could speak Cantonese. But due to an old aircraft the seat is not comfortable and the inflight entertainment system is no work for my seat.   Singapore to Guangzhou. The boarding gate in Terminal 3 A20, so far away. Cabin crew are nice and one of them is from Chinese. They offered supper and several types of drinks including welcome drink. But the aircraft is old and the seat is not comfortable, the ear phone is not work even I change for 3 times.   Frankfurt to Singapore, Business Class. I got an email early morning on 9 January to notify me that the flight  was to be delayed by 2 hours. As I was connecting with Air New Zealand at Singapore onwards to Auckland with a short connection time, I thought the chance of catching the connecting flight to Auckland was going to be impossible. That proved correct. Prior to arriving at the airport, I rung both SQ and Air New Zealand. Both airlines claimed it was each otherÆ’??s responsibility. In short, SQ was to blame for the disruption, so it was their responsibility to put things right. When we were due to board at Frankfurt, the A380 was not at the terminal, it was at a distant part of the airport so we were bussed to the plane which seemed to be miles away. When we finally arrived at the plane, we had to climb a set of steep stairs to enter the plane. Considering the delayed flight and the inconvenience we had been through, the greeting from the staff was very ho-hum. The crew seemed to be grumpy during this flight. The poor guy in front of me had a seat adjacent to the galley door way. He asked to be reseated somewhere else in the business section. The stewardessÆ’??s response was, sorry, we are fully booked. This wasnÆ’??t the case as there was a vacant seat behind me. The meals were very Asian, with a lot of seafood options, in some cases I chose to forego the course as there was just nothing I liked. I would recommend SQÆ’??s book the cook option. There are far more options available using this than SQ offers on the flight. Come time to sleep, my bed was broken. It lay flat ok, its just that when I put my weight on the bed the feet end of the bed couldnÆ’??t sustain the weight and my feet would go right through to the floor. I slept, but it wasnÆ’??t great. I wasnÆ’??t the only one to complain of this problem. When the flight arrived in Singapore there were a team of SQ agents waiting for arriving passengers whose connecting flights were affected by the delay. In all fairness, SQ did handle this very well, they provided a 4 star airport hotel for 12 hours along with 3 meals. The journey on to New Zealand continued with SQ and I can basically say, I saw a repeat of the service issues I had on the Frankfurt/Singapore flight. I canÆ’??t recommend SQ and probably wonÆ’??t chose to fly with them again.   Tokyo to Los Angeles. Cabin was clean and with decent space for knee room for a 53 female. Complimentary 2 bag check in which was nice. Amenity kit provided complimentary containing tooth brush, paste, and socks. No slippers or eye mask as other airlines. Bathroom needed to be better maintained as waste bin was full by hour 4 out of 12 hour flight, soaps in disarray and bathroom prep tray (mouth wash etc). Special meal service was kind although a bit disappointing as you do not decide what meal you would like to eat but it is already prepared generic western style of whatever meal selection chosen. I wouldÆ’??ve loved to pick my meal with the changes applied, especially knowing tickets were booked ahead enough. Food was decent, but often the crew would overlook my seat and miss out several beverage//snack passes due to special needs. This was not at all an issue flying USA to Japan. But an issue on this flight. Main complaint is how crew couldÆ’??ve done better to handle special requests with passengers. I booked and had a seat arranged, by surprise there were no shows in my row. Instead of privately making me aware of any request, an attendant publicly asked for my seating reassignment so that I may switch places with another passenger so that they my lie across the row with their bad knee. IÆ’??m partially deaf in one ear and spinal braced. Instead of privately requesting in writing, the crew member and requesting passenger makes a scene for me to move because I am unable to hear. So speaking louder while in flight should be better. There should be a better way for flight crew to handle those with special needs such as mute, deafness, and hidden disabilities instead of causing a scene or skipping passengers who cannot speak. Be like other airlines that have crew member buttons on the seat panels such where passengers can press for assistance or communicate needs.   Delhi to Singapore. Smooth check in at New Delhi airport where they do also weigh your hand carry; something I did not see at Changi. Boarding procedures were seamless. The dated seat on the 772 was quite comfortable although there was no USB port to charge smartphones. Beautiful celebratory wreaths decorated the cabin walls. Singapore Airlines give big, fluffy pillows and blankets in economy class. You can select newspapers and headphones while boarding. Hot towels and menus were served.  Singapore Airlines service standards are stellar. IFE on board differed on the 777 and A380. Screens unfortunately were not that clear or clean on both aircraft. The vegetarian oriental meals I ordered on both flights were super. Crew provide refreshments and the cabin presence on board was beyond any other airline in economy class I have flown.   Business class from Haneda to Singapore. The airline had the old cabin product, and it really shows. The panel which supposed to cover the compartment to store smaller items near the screen was missing, and the steward explained that only the engineering people can fix this. The seat was wide, however the awkward shape of the leg area makes it very hard to be comfortable, as we had to sleep diagonally (the new cabin product as we see online removed this problem). First class seats did not have this issue. Sleeper service (our flight departed at 10.50 pm) means that supper was only two course (instead of the three courses with Satay) - which was main meal and a bowl of fruit. Inflight entertainment offered the latest movies, however the screen was quite old and we noticed some scratches on the screen. Service was exceptional trademark of Singapore Airlines. I would recommend this airline despite the old product still.   Bangkok to Singapore. This sector was the second sector of my flight back from Vienna, the VIE-BKK sector being on Austrian Airlines. As a short 2-hour regional flight, SQ still lives up to its reputation of being a premium airline. Shortly after take-off, dinner service commenced with a choice of 2 main courses. Being a short flight, menu cards were not distributed to passengers. Instead, flight attendants showed passengers a menu card with photos of the main courses and descriptions of the meal. I had the chicken casserole with penne pasta. Drinks and coffee or tea were served at the same time. As it was a short flight, I did not watch any movies on the IFE. One difference that I noticed was that earphones distributed were of the in-ear type instead of the over-ear type typically used by SQ. Perhaps in a move to save costs, headphones in economy are no longer of the over-ear type? I canÆ’??t confirm this as it has been some years since I have flown SQ economy.   Z?Â¬rich to Singapore in March 2013. As I do my booking pretty early Im often able to reserve a seat in the wing area. So thats 40+. Therefore I board the plane late to avoid queuing. To my surprise all three seats were free and it remained like this. As I ordered previously my special meal online, I got it before actual service starts. This time a tenderloin absolutely tasty. Cabin crew as usual very aware, theyre able to read your wishes from the eyes. Even a small talk is possible.   Z?Â¬rich to Bangkok via Singapore. As usual very polite cabin crew. I became sick during the flight. They did everything possible to make my flight as comfortable as possible. I was asking/ordering on internet for special meal. Therefore I was served right at the beginning of menu supply. Food was as always very tasty.   Munich to Ho Chi Minh City via Singapore. I will never fly with this airline again. My wife and I booked two seats from Madrid to Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. We had a big drama at the airport in Munich because 20 min before departure their ground crew decided to asked us for a return flight from Vietnam. We had the approval letter from the Vietnamese Immigration letter which was shown to them. The only requirement is to have the approval letter and pay for the visa on arrival. This information was co-overrated by the Immigration department in Vietnam upon our arrival to HCMC. It is also important to note that this wasnt our first time in Vietnam and no airline staff has ever asked us for an outgoing flight. What really makes me angry though is that their ground crew left it to the very last minute to ask us for the return flight. It was an incredibly stressful booking a flight on the spot, only having 10 minutes or so to do it. We almost missed our flight because of their incompetence. To make matters worse the cabin crew was incredibly rude and unpleasant. One of the staff members didnt even bother to use the word please. How can these people work in the travel/tourism industry? On arrival to Vietnam, we found out that both of our suitcases were damaged. The airline did replace them however we had to go through the drama of filling out forms/taking photos at the airport after a very long flight.    Dusseldorf to Hanoi via Singapore. Both segments were truly pleasant flights. The check-in and boarding were well organized and quick. The cabin crews on both flights were very kind and helpful. On DUS-SIN they frequently served drinks, snacks and apples were available as well. I had the same excellent experience on SGN-SIN and SIN-DUS, so I would definitely fly with Singapore Airlines again.   Singapore to Amsterdam. I felt so welcomed by the crew. The flight attendants were helping and greeting passengers and bringing them to their seat and helped them putting away their hand luggage.  The meal service was very quick and efficient. Overall they flight was very pleasant and comfortable! The flight attendants did Singapore Airlines proud and showed why this airlines has one of the best crew service! I would recommend everybody to fly Singapore Airlines.   Cape Town to Singapore. Dont bother to hang your jacket. Dont bother to help open up your bedding but one has to struggle with it oneself. Rude interaction. Dont bother to help with opening the table for meals. Often forget to offer some passengers cheese and fruit when it is standard for all business class. Poor lounge food choice with only Indian food available to eat. Dont allow couples to travel together.   Singapore to Bangkok. It was a very pleasant flight, no delay, quick and effective service at fantastic Singapore airport. Although the flight was almost full the services on board were well organized. Of course I should mention wonderful air hostess. They looked like top models.  Overall it was 5 star flight.   Jakarta to Singapore. Exemplary customer service experience from Garuda and Singapore Airlines. Our flight scheduled to depart at 15:20 from Pontianak to Jakarta on 27 March, was delayed for 3 hours due to bad weather (heavy thunderstorm). We missed our connecting flight scheduled to depart at 19:00 from Jakarta to Singapore. Upon arrival in Jakarta we brought our case to Garuda customer service and it was promptly processed. Theres no flight available for the day so we were put in hotel with dinner and breakfast voucher. The next day Garuda customer service staff went to Singapore Airlines office and they were able to release 2 tickets for us to fly back to Singapore on that day. A gracious and much appreciated act from Garuda and Singapore Air. Thank you!  My experience with Singapore Airlines was decent at best. The airline fails to compare to the Middle East carriers such as Emirates. My Singapore to Mumbai journey was in an old 777 with a very uncomfortable seat that left me with a backache. The entertainment system on both the 777 and A380 were archaic and cumbersome to use. Definitely didnt feel worth the premium price that I paid for the ticket.   San Francisco to Singapore via Hong Kong. Beautiful seats with such comfort. Sufficient storage space. If you long for Singapore cuisine there is tons on board. Whilst I did not eat the crew reserved a banana for me before we landed. The SFO-HKG was uneventful as the crew were kind switched off the lights early allowing us to sleep.  The HKG-SIN sector departed on time and the HKG ground crew and lounge staff were very courteous attending to any questions I had about my allergies. The crew was quick to get us our drinks and meals and then we settled to do our work or watch a movie. My suggestion is that if the crew is aware that on board wifi is not available for the initial part of the HKG-SIN as apparently the networks are not that great. This will be very helpful.   Singapore to San Francisco. The A350 seats were somewhat closer than the Boeing 777. The seats has the length but does not appear to be as wide. The toilet is very cool with state of the art flushing etc. Normally I am able to sleep well on board but maybe because it is a day flight I suffered from jet lag later in the week. Crew was excellent and attentive to our needs and there were loads of request for food by my fellow passengers.   Brisbane to Singapore. This flight was in an older A340 that does not have flat bed seats. It is fine for a day time flight but having flown this at night previously is not good for a refreshing sleep. Check in was a bit slow and rude, being directed by one staff member to a check in agent who put up her hand to my face to indicate for me to stop while she did something else. Lounge was basic but all I wanted was a coffee. Flight left on time, brunch and snacks were both tasty, of a high quality and large in size. Quality of coffee on board was excellent, too. Crew were great and the wine was good. Attempted a couple of hours sleep which was not great due to the seat. Off the plane at the closest gate to immigration and through customs in 5 minutes and the bags were magically waiting to be picked up. All up a very enjoyable trip that would have been improved through travelling on a plane with the new long haul business class seats.   Flew roundtrip on Singapore Airlines new nonstop route between San Francisco and Singapore in Premium Economy on the outbound and regular Coach class upon returning. The premium seat was decent, but I wasnt as impressed with the rest of the setup or the soft product. With the hard partition toward business class in front, and the service area / galley located well to the rear past an economy section, the premium economy area on this aircraft is a virtual dead-end rarely patrolled by flight attendants. On the SFO-SIN sector, received two meals during the 16h20m flight, with no other proactive service - no separate drink runs prior to the meals either. You had to press the call button for anything, mid-flight snacks were available but again, nothing was offered voluntarily. Flight attendants seemed to do what was required but without a smile. No landing cards handed out. Except for the seat itself, the service on the return flight SIN-SFO in regular Economy was actually better, with a pre-lunch drinks run (from a tray, not a full cart) and follow-up hot beverage service after the meal. As with the outbound flight, however, the second meal service - a breakfast - took place about six hours before landing, what gives? The check-in experience at SFO was ok, but at SIN economy passengers are herded toward self check-in kiosks and self baggage tagging whether they like it or not. I have only flown SIA once before, but based on my limited experience with them so far, I wouldnt go out of my way to fly them - although I would chose them again if they offered a convenient schedule at a decent price point.   First time with Singapore Airlines. Got to Sydney airport early. Checked in online and dropped bags. Friendly ground crew directed me to Business Class check in counter as the online check in counter was busy with another passenger. No issues and was issued boarding pass seamlessly. Boarding at Gate 61, a bit chaotic as there are very few seats in that part of the airport for all passengers on a full A380. Departure delayed one hour due to bad weather but was handled professionally by captain and was able to make my connection in SIN. Meal ok, but cabin crew seemed almost robotic, rehearsed and fake. Lacked human touch and could probably be replaced by a few well programmed robots. Seat 60K in economy. After sometime realized my back was aching. Discovered that seat had no lumbar support, some did, mine didnt and couldnt fully recline either. Not pleasant for a 7 hour flight to SIN. Didnt bother complaining as crew was nowhere to be found after meal service and were happy to switch off lights and disappear. Entertainment system, a bit dated, probably the original system used with the first A380 flights and some buttons required a harder press on the remote as had been worn out. Had about 200 movies but I mostly listen to music while flying. Choice of music was mediocre, so decided to use my iPod instead. No free WiFi quota. Same continued on SIN-CMB leg except seat had lumbar support this time, didnt turn on entertainment system this time. I think SQ is highly overrated and not a patch on Emirates or even some non 5 star airlines. Would consider others before SQ next time.   SQ 305 from LHR to SIN onboard Singapore Airs Boeing 777 four class cabin was one of the best long haul in economy flights Ive endured. The service is great, a regular drink tray with waters and juices being brought to you to keep you hydrated. The food was decent for economy class standards and they also offered a small snack (sandwich) and second meal. A small amenity pack was provided and consisted of a toothbrush and socks - nothing special but still a tick in the box which some airlines have cut back on. The headrest of the seat is comfy and is made of leather which gives it class. Ambient lighting during the night hours gave a relaxed and upmarket feel. The best part of the Economy seat was the entertainment system which consisted of a large screen - bigger than an iPad size and then has a small digital control below; it all works well and is also touchscreen and the quality and size is better than Ive seen on BA business 747. Overall the most comfy and best way to fly direct to Singapore from London in economy class but price will still dictate choices and whilst Id pay a small Premium to fly Singapore again a harder discount from BA or Garuda would sway me.   Singapore to Paris. Excellent staff service. Thank, once again, to cabin crew who provided excellent service during the flight,and were always smiling, patient, prompt and helpful. The food and beverage was satisfied. Thank, also, to pilots for so sweet landing in Parisian fog.   Sydney to Singapore. We are very disappointed that we arrived 5 hours before the departure to get seats in row 30s and we were told its all full. As we are older people in early 70s. We were told we should select our seats by Internet. We checked 48hrs before departure online however all seats were allocated, the seats available were the same seats open 48hrs ago. What a shame that airline has no remorse to senior people. We are seating in toilet class row 56s. As seniors we make two or three trips a year however we havent encountered this situation in our travelling time. Manager was not considerate or seriously shown any interest. Remember sorry does not make pain go away. I will advise the all the family and friends not to travel Singapore Airlines in future.   Dubai to Singapore via Penang. First time fly with Singapore Airlines and will be final. I thought everything is perfect not until when I received my new luggage, with the Protection cover missing and the pocket zip is broken. When I file a complaint to Customer service, and the response is that it is due to the luggage is wear and tear, Singapore Airlines could not submit the damage claim to the insurance company and thats it. My conclusion, Singapore Airlines is very irresponsible, if you want to fly with them please ensure your luggage is wrapped or use the old luggage.  Singapore to Sydney. I always fly Singapore Airlines as it offers the most direct flights out of Singapore. Flew on SQ241 on Feb 8th. SQ advises that all their SQ flights with B777-300ER and A350/380 has wi-fi. Unfortunately this flight has no WiFi despite it being a B777-300ER plus flying out at 0700 one would expect a little breakfast. Sadly there was no meals until 12 noon Singapore time which means about 3pm Sydney time. I overheard an American passenger asking for some food as he was hungry. I can understand that most of the passengers are doing a transit but there are many of us who are just starting our day and with a flight at 0700 there is not much time for breakfast. I would appreciate if SQ indicate clearly which flights have wifi and not a blanket statement about the aircraft.   Manila to Hong Kong via Singapore. Excellent service from their staff. Food is good and generous its hard to beat. Singapore Airlines innovates and tries further to give better service to their customers. Plane feels a bit old already but facilities and amenities are well appointed.   Singapore to Munich, and travelled this sector twice within 6 months so my review is based on mix of both. Boarding at Changi is consistent and zone wise boarding. Check-in staff, passport and boarding card checks are very friendly. On boarding the flight crew looked less enthusiastic then I know of. There was a sense of disorganisation. The senior crew jetted through cabin with a frown and certainly created a negative environment. Once in the air, meal and drink service was conducted. I use book the cook service and was served about 30 mins before fellow passengers which I find bit awkward. Again, the meals can be elabotate for this class but I found portions are small and not filling. Service lacked enthusiasm, warmth and smile on both the sectors and cabin crew were indifferent. Some were good and some were kind of forced to work. SIA provides good entertainment system so while watching movies, I decided to get a snack from middle galley and crew were friendly but didnt see them throughout the flight atleast on my side of aisle. On one of the flight, I asked for a coffee and it was brewed very strong even by European standards with the reason given that Europeans only drink strong coffee. The crew in back galley were sad and angry. On the positive side, SIA 777-300 has spacious toilets. Entertainment system is good and seat is spacious enough for the class. All in all, MUC flights are out of Singapore Airlines pattern. I read review of another passenger in this forum also travelling to MUC and found to be negative. I have made some good experiences on thier other sectors and based on it, I do recommend Singapore Airlines. I hope SIA will rectify the crew issue on this segment and hear the plight in catering segment for Premium Economy on all segments.   Melbourne to Mumbai via Singapore. My recent journey with Singapore Airlines was really great, the crew was friendly and helpful.  Me and wife were traveling with 1 year old baby and we felt like one of the staff was appointed specially to us. We are very happy with the service. Thank you Singapore Airlines. I would give 10/10 for service, but I have to give only 7/10 for flight as it was very old and noisy flight .   Seoul to Melbourne via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Both sectors of this trip were fantastic. I rated all aspects of the flight experience very highly. Starting from the smooth check-in to the high quality food served at the lounges to the care from the flight crew. The meals were very good especially when the Book the chef option is used. Its worth noting that the business class suites on the Boeing 777-300ER was newer than the ones on A380-800 but despite having a few more features (incl. newer AVOD and more storage compartments) both were really comfortable and spacious.   Singapore to New York via Frankfurt. I have flown the SIN-NYC route 4 times in the last 15 months. In my earlier trips, I flew with a large European carrier and two different Middle Eastern carriers. I last flown SQ on this route over 8 years ago so I can compare the recent experience with that from 8 years ago. The main thing to me that distinguished SQ service from competitors is cabin crew service. One thing which I felt was lacking though is the smiles that SQs crew used to be famous for. Some of the more senior staff still has that touch and could make a positive impression but increasingly, I noticed in my last 8 or so flights on SQ in the past 12 months, that the crew are no longer as at ease or friendly as they used to be. A small minority seem a little indifferent which drags SQ reputation down. Their service adds a shine to the brand even though the hardware is not as impressive as the Middle Eastern carriers. A380 feels older compared with the B787s and A350s that many airlines are now using. Despite the older planes, I find the generous seat width a life saver. Other details include lights under the IFE screens which gave good coverage for each passengers immediate area but do not disturb surrounding passengers. Another detail is the foot pedal activated trash bins in the toilets, helps not having to push the bins lids using our hands. There was good crew presence throughout the entire flight. The food portion is generous and quality better than other carriers I have flown. I cant wait to experience the A350 on this route, and hopefully the cabin crew will be better trained and motivated.   London Heathrow to Singapore. Was expecting more but very good all the same. Never flown Singapore Airlines for some reason. Used the United Airlines lounge at LHR T2 as better facilities, great breakfast and bar. Boarding ontime. Boeing 777-300ER with new business but not that new now. Took row 11 bulkhead, feet forward as opposed to angle. Great space for Business class with 1-2-1 seating. Far bigger than British Airways F seats. First Cabin of business only 3 rows so intimate. Being an early morning service brunch was served. A little too quickly for my liking virtually immediately after levelling out. Preordered book the cook Lobster , very good. Service and quality of food excellent. Cabin staff attentive if a little sterile. My TV system wouldnt work for a few hours. Crew tried hard to rectify and offered to move our seats. FInally got it working all ok. Flight services director appeared later with a SGD200 voucher for the inconvenience. That is good customer service. Slept for 4 hours. Breakfast prior arrival SIN good, arrived early. All in all great hard product, good food and service.   Copenhagen to Brisbane via Singapore. SAS Lounge in CPN comfortable and food looked OK, was not sure re wine out of a tap and so left this alone. The only other alcohol in the Business Class lounge was beer. Flight left on time and crew started working down one side of the Business Class cabin almost immediately, the other side took substantially longer. In any case the crew were helpful, the food was fine and the seat comfortable. Wine was good and topped up. A short stay in the lounge at Changi T3 and then re-boarded the same plane at the same gate (different flight number). Crew still fine but food was not up to scratch, the steak was very overcooked to the point of being really tough. The vegetables were mush, I didnt eat much and the crew member asked if I wanted anything else but I went to sleep instead. Supper coming into Brisbane was better. Waited 25 minutes for one bag in BNE, the other didnt arrive. Filled in the details at the airport. Have not heard back, no one answers the baggage service phone although you can leave a message that no one responds to as well. Calling Singapore Airlines they give you the number for Menzies Aviation that you have already called, they also mentioned that they would call back but have not. The online bag track system has had the same message on it for 6 days. In all the standard here is not commensurate with the full business class fare paid. The main advantage of the flights was being able to sleep, arriving on time is good but not when you are without your luggage and the follow up is so poor.   Singapore Airlines is dropping their lead over other airlines. While service is still consistent as it was for many years, nothing has changed and the food is everytime getting worse. I have flown Singapore Airlines in last 2 months a few times and the main courses offered I could not eat them and left them. No question asked of course. Being the most expensive and for long time leading they better watch or they will soon have tough competition.   Frankfurt to Singapore. Superb product! Right from boarding till reaching Changi. Boarding began in time and orderly, zone wise boarding which helped in quick boarding and we left within 25 minutes considering it was a fairly full flight. We were greeted by delightful and genuine crew. The aircraft was clean and business class is the best I have seen. Premium economy seats are very comfortable with lots of options to store gadgets, charging point, usb port and big hd screen with many options. As soon as we were airborne, hot towel service followed by snack and drink followed by meals. I used the cook the book service, passengers using such option are served first, this doesnt allow you to dine with your fellow passengers unless you wait. Usual meal service was hurried and crew seemed to be in stress as economy in back was completely booked out. The meal by itself was okay. For premium economy I would have expected to be elaborate. Trays were collected after a while and rolled down service. After some hours I tried thier snack service, crew delightfully greeted and opened snack options and gave me more than requested. Fresh fruits, sandwiches, chocolate waffles and crisps. The crew was also courteous enough to inquire if they could do anything so that I can sleep for a while. I also noticed that crew went through cabin couple of times to anticipate our needs. Although captain announced turbulence and turned on seatbelt sign, crew walked through cabin with torch to check seat belts and ensured we fasten it. They even fasten seat belts for passengers who were sleeping, never seen such care on another airline. Breakfast was served before landing and immigration cards were handed in time. At all times, crew were caring and meticulously dressed. I am very impressed by Singapore Airlines and thier product. Definately my first option to Asia.    Singapore to San Francisco. I have an email with my itinerary showing the flight is from Singapore to San Francisco. There are no words about a 1hr 30 mins stop in Hong Kong. Only today I realized the flight is through Hong Kong. If I had known that, I wouldnt choose this company at all. The agent was surprised to see my itinerary as it clearly shows this is a direct flight.    Singapore to Chennai return. The outbound flight was excellent in terms of being on time, the inflight service was impeccable. The seafood that I normally order was very very good. The flight crew were friendly and helpful as I needed some help with ordering in flight duty free goods. On the return from Chennai to Singapore, the service during the flight was bad. The cabin crew with their robotic attitude were interested to finish the service as soon as possible, to disappear from sight. Other than that I do not have any complaint to make.   Perth to Vientiane via Singapore. Beware the stopover with Singapore Airlines. My husband flew straight home from Laos but the rest of us - myself and our 3 teenagers - decided to stay in Singapore for 4 nights. I would have thought the national airline would be encouraging passengers to stay and spend money in their country. We were charged an extra $437.50 per person to do this. On emailing and phoning the airline on several occasions the explanation given was the flights were a different code. With further enquiry I was told that departure tax was part of the cost. This, when asked, amounted to about $30 each! So I wont be flying with Singapore Airlines again and suggest you check the cost of your tickets to see how much extra you will be paying to stayover   Sydney to London Heathrow via Singapore. I normally fly China Southern business class from Sydney to London and I pay for the tickets myself as I fly to the UK to see my parents and family. This year my father turns 90 in February so I am flying to London twice this year and in order to save $2000 I decided that one flight had to be an economy one. Not being able to face true economy I booked a Premium economy seat with Singapore Airlines. I have flown Premium economy with other airlines over the years, Qantas, BA and Virgin Atlantic (when they still flew to Oz). Firstly having booked the ticket with an online travel agent I went on to the Singapore Airlines internet site and was able to select my seat and Book the Chef meals. 10 out of 10 for their on-line presence, easy to use compared with China Southern which is a nightmare. At the airport no queue for the dedicated Premium economy checkin. Staff member very polite. No lounge access but Sydney Airport has plenty of places to sit comfortably and is not too busy. Boarding was a breeze as Premium economy have priority with Business and First. On the plane the FAs were all smiles and assisted passengers with their luggage and thats something I havent seen for a while. Boarding was swift on both sectors, the captains introduced themselves and we left on time. Soon after the seat belt sign went off the drinks were served. I prefer being given a minature gin and can of tonic rather than just being served it in a glass. Also no slice of lemon. The meal service came next all served on one tray. The quality of the food was good, but very small and no different from economy. Throughout the flight FAs came around with water and if a passenger wanted a drink or snack they were provided. The FAs were always polite and friendly and came when requested. I never drink much alcohol when flying so the water was adequate. we arrived early on both sectors, disembarkation was quick. My flight cost A$3100 return, an economy ticket on the same flights A$1300, a China Southern Business Class ticket A$4800 if booked at the same time. So there is the rub was it worth it. Well yes and no. The seat is more comfortable, even with the seat in front fuly reclined I still had space, the screen is large and clear and the available entertainment exhaustive. The problem arises when the Singapore Airlines product is compared to the likes of Qantas, it just doent feel special. There are no seperate toilets, the food is the same as economy, during the flight the curtain between Premium economy and economy is not even closed. In other words all you are buying is a bigger seat with more space, an ecomomy plus rather than a Premium Economy and is that worth the extra A$1800. I dont think so. If I could have my time again I think I would either spend the extra A$1700 and fly business with China Southern or have stopped over on each direction with $1800 to spend on hotels and entertainment.   Tokyo Haneda to Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Old Boeing 777-300 but refurbished. PTVs are not the latest ones, no touchscreen but good picture quality. Good service, but cost cutting measures were too apparent. SIA used to gorgeously serve meals to economy passengers. Now, the big meal tray comes with only one small box of mains, another super tiny box of salad, one piece of cold bread and thats it. They also need to increase speed of in flight meal. Learn from other airlines such as United and Air China. They are super meh airline companies but their speed of conducting meal service is admirable.   Singapore to Paris CDG. Its been nearly 5 years since I last flew SIA and although just a single flight so far, I was bitterly disappointed. A380 business class section was looking a bit tired, seats worn and not the standards I remember. The biggest shock was how poor the cabin staff service was, almost from start to finish. Yes, they got the service done, but there wasnt a single smile or sign of expected service courtesy, they appeared bored and wanting to finish as quickly as they could. I fly a lot of other airlines around Asia, and whilst many of them have gotten much better in recent times, things seem to have gone the other way for SIA. Have the return flight next week and will update after that.   Singapore to Copenhagen. I usually fly this route with Singapore Airlines and have found my satisfaction declining with their offer lately. There was over a one and a half hour delay to our departure with no apology from the captain or crew when we landed in Copenhagen. There was quite some turbulence on this flight and the plane appeared to be struck by lightning at one point which was also not commented on by the captain despite many passengers being visibly shaken by the experience. The Boeing 777-200 had an old interior with the entertainment system not working on my seat nor those of my two companions. The interiors of these planes are simply not up to standard for a 5-star airline and are well overdue for their scheduled upgrade. The crew were courteous and attentive and regularly came through the cabin with refreshments.   Manchester to Houston. Boarding, food, space of seats, customer service etc all excellent. 10/10 and will use again. I booked this flight as it was good value and a direct flight for our trip. First time using Singapore Airlines and would say they are the best airline I have been on. Looked after so well on the flight. Even getting different seat options to give us more space. Just great service.    I flew on Singapore Airlines (SQ) from Sydney to Chennai via Singapore last December. This was my first time on SQ and was quite excited about the journey as I had heard a lot about them. General: All my flights were on-time infact some arriving a bit earlier. The seat allocation in manage booking was restrictive when compared to competitors. I wanted to allocate a window seat and it was showing as all the seats were taken. Luckily when I checked-in, it showed one window seat on each sector and I was able to take it. Not sure why SQ should make it complicated. I do understand they have to block some seats to cater to their frequent flyers etc.. but that doesnt mean you block the whole flight. Value for money: The ticket prices are on the higher side compared to competitors. However, I am willing to pay for quality hence I would opt for SQ. Ground service: Ground staff in both Sydney and Singapore were friendly and the check-in process was smooth. Seat comfort: The seats were spacious. Though I am average sized I felt even a bigger person would be able to sit comfortably. Cabin staff service: Cabin crew are one of the friendliest in the world. Prompt service. My only disappointment was when a request was made for some additional alcoholic drink (within usual limits in a competitor), I got a feeling that the crew were not enthusiastic. I am not sure whether this is due to the airline policy or it was the cabin crews perspective. Also when you request a spirit, its taken like a special order which will come after a while. Ideally they are supposed to have it along with the other drinks (like other competitors do) and should be served instantly. Food & beverages: The quality of food was excellent. The quantity could be a bit more but I will live with it. Inflight entertainment: One of their weakest points. In this current era of touch screens, we have to use remote control on both their A380 and A330-300 fleet. Also the choice of movies are very limited, a cheap take-away earphone and outdated software. I wouldnt mind if they provide a better headset and collect it at the end of the flight. I have read that their retrofitted B777-300ER and A350-900 come with touch screens. But that doesnt help anyone as A380 and A330-300 still forms a bulk of their fleet and are deployed on key routes. As an aviation enthusiast I used to enjoy the onboard camera with a competitor, unfortunately its not available on SQ. Cabin Wifi: The rates are really expensive when compared to some of the competitors. It didnt also work for a good part of the journey. I am aware there are restricted zones but I have flown on the similar route with another competitor and havent had much issues with the Wifi. Overall, I would fly Singapore Airlines again and hopefully some of the above issues may be resolved with more A350s being delivered.  Copenhagen to Singapore. Normally I fly BA, but this was the most direct flight to our final destination. My first time traveling Singapore Airlines in business and it was in a class of its own. Attention to detail was incredible, food tasted and looked great and the seat (even though it was there old seat) was so wide and comfortable it was great for lounging and sleeping. The crew were super attentive but I feel they lack in making conversation. IFE I felt could also be improved but these are minor details for an otherwise impeccable flight.  It was my first time aboard the new Singapore Airlines A350. Although it was a very short flight between Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, it was fantastic. The A350 cabin seems very bright and spacious, the Singapore Airlines design is elegant and modern. The crew was outstandingly friendly and professional and made this short hop one of the best flights Ive ever taken.   Flight from London Heathrow to Singapore. I had booked the flight through a partner airline and had made several attempts to arrange an aisle seat prior to the flight, however as it was a full flight, this was not possible. However, the airline did assign seats prior to the departure, which was helpful. I have flown with Singapore Airlines several times, and cant fault their inflight crew, who are helpful and try to accommodate any requests. Is one of my preferred airline for bookings in the future.  Moscow to Sydney via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. Our airplane had a technical issue on the Moscow to Singapore (A350 SQ361) leg. Passengers were kept inside of the airplane for 6 hours while the plane remained on the ground in Moscow airport. SQ did not arrange return of passengers back to the terminal. Neither hot meal was served onboard only a pack of chips within 6 hours. Crew provided little and infrequent information. Some passengers panicked and disembarked. We missed our connecting flight to Sydney and had to spend an extra 9 hours waiting for the next flight. As a result of the delay I was supposed to go to work straight from the airport after 38 hours of the prolonged journey. The airline asked me to write a detailed letter describing what happened. I spent my time and did that. In return I received a standard email with apologies.   Bangkok to Singapore return. I had little to no queue at the check-in counters at both Bangkok and Singapore airports. Boarding was orderly and in accordance to the boarding group indicated on the tickets. In Bangkok, the staff hold up clear signs indicating doors to use by premium passengers and economy passengers. The A330 was quite new and comfortable. The screen for the IFE is large and has plenty of movies and programmes available. Two options were available for meals and in both journeys, I got my choice of meal despite sitting in the last row. I opted for the red chicken curry for the outgoing flight and stir fried pork with fried rice for the return flight. Both delicious and portions adequate. Although the seats were in the last row, they were able to recline with some room to spare before hitting the wall. The toilets were near the last row of seats but they were positioned further back, toward the galley area. Cabin crew worked hard on this 2 hour flight with hot towels given at the beginning of the flight and a meal service with coffee/tea run after the meal. One thing useful is the foot pedal that is attached to the toilet trashbins. This is a feature I have not seen on some new planes of other airlines. Toilets were well stocked.   Brisbane to Singapore and the experience was a pleasant one from the very first welcome. I am overjoyed that Singapore Airlines has reinstated the lager B777-200ER on this route especially in Business Class as it provides a 1-2-1 layout, with the long haul business class product rather than the 2-2-2 regional layout. The crew was very attentive and welcoming, taking meal orders before take off. Food was excellent as were drinks.On the overnight flight you have the choice of either a meal after take off or before landing. I choose mine after take off wanting to sleep. I was awake for breakfast and was offered the continental breakfast. The IFE on this plane is a little bit older as is most notciable on the flight path screen and the old remote, but still an excellent selection. The flight was 45 minutes ahead of schedule because of strong tail winds.   
Singapore Airlines new route Singapore - Canberra - Wellington - Canberra - Singapore. Flights to and from Singapore are overnight flights departing 23.00 from Singapore and midnight from Canberra to Singapore. Old plane but has 34 inch pitch in economy, heaven compared to other airlines 31-32 inches. Seats are quite firm but a good 19 inches wide. In both directions the meal is only a snack with a drink after takeoff, served really quickly to be able to turn the lights off. Extra drinks only on request. This allows Wellington passengers to get some sleep as they have already had a 3 hour flight to Canberra and a 1 hour transit. Breakfast is generous served with coffee and tea refills. The other bonus for this flight for Canberra residents is not having to get to Sydney or Melbourne and not having to deal with Sydney airport. For many Canberra residents it is only a fifteen minute drive to Canberra airport, check in is fast as it is the only flight out. With internet check in it is a bag drop. You can leave home two hours before take off and be in the departure lounge with time for a drink before boarding.   Amsterdam to Singapore. I was looking forward to fly the A350. After booking the flight I received an offer to upgrade to Premium Economy, but I rejected after reading a number of reviews. The flight was departing behind schedule due to passengers who did not turn up and a time consuming de-icing process. I am glad I did not take the Premium Economy upgrade offer. Walking through the Premium Economy section during boarding I did not experience much added value by looking at the hard product, compared to Y. The seats look pretty narrow as well and not that much pitch. The business seats look great though. The Economy product is very nice in my opinion. Seats are maybe a little bit narrower than in the Boeing 777-300, but the pitch was good (I am 1.80m tall, enough space), decent recline and a huge entertainment touch screen which was awesome. The cabin felt spacious because of the high ceilings. Also higher humidity. Great aircraft! I was very dissapointed in the cabin noise level.  Yes, take off was less noisy but not during the flight itself. I think it will be less noisy in front of the aircraft but not sure about that. Customer service was good (not exceptional) and the meals were delicious.  One of the best meals ever had on a plane. I appreciate the metal cutlery and hot towel cloths. Overall, it was a great flight and I am looking forward to the next one! And I made my connection flight (which was very tight) thanks to the very efficient airport of Changi.   Melbourne to London return via Singapore. Have always Singapre Airlines with high regard until my most recent trip to London. When we booked in January 2015, we could not book premium economy on the MEL to SIN leg, as at that time there was no premium economy on this leg. This has now changed but only on some flights. MEL to SIN in Economy, an older plane with inflight entertainment screen to boot. The screen was awful, so if you flying on another SIA flight, hold back and watch the movies you want to watch on a better screen. Service was very average, IFE was poor, food was very poor. Singapore to London in Premium Economy The only advantage in taking premium economy is the seat pitch and thats it. This is a very poor attempt at premium economy and it is a complete rip off. Inflight entertainment was poor, a much larger screen, so great for movies, the only plus. My small hand held control panel did not work. The entertainment system kept resetting itself at the end of every movie or programme. One ear in the headphones did not work. Service was poor - In premium economy you are placed in front of economy and behind business class. The service is provided by the economy cabin staff. Could not call for service as my hand held control panel did not work. The toilets are down in economy, none near premium economy. Food was very Poor -  Economy class food. The only reason why Ive given a score of 2 is because they have the book the cook service, but that is still economy class standard food. Remember, you are paying double the price for this seat. Flight arrived 25 minutes late. Return legs London to Singapore in premium economy was exactly the same but this time the entertainment system kept resetting itself, the headphones worked and so did the hand held control panel. Singapore to Melbourne in Economy - the breakfast on economy is as poor as you get with airline food. A cold bread roll, hard cold butter, cold muffin, cold unripe fruit.  The TV screen on this plane was up to date but still had issues with it freezing. We had a seat between us, so basically it was the same as flying premium economy but without paying twice the price. I had made a complaint to SQ a month before flying and this complaint has not been responded to. On all counts SQ have really dropped the ball. I would not recommend Singapore Airlines, especially if you are looking to fly premium economy.   Singapore to Hong Kong. Original A380 but was swapped out for a Boeing 777, so a little disappointed. My last experience with them was on a Boeing 747 (wasnt great then), and their service has improved considerably since. Check in was friendly and fuss free, and got along my way really quick. The IFE is rather dated but the selection was rich. Cabin interior was cosy and comfortable despite the age of the aircraft, making itself rather distinguishable from their sister budget air Scoot. The most memorable part was the food, which is a portion rather worthy of premium economy or even business class of other airlines. Return to Singapore an A330 looked newer and IFE was touch-screen. Cabin crew quickly served drinks and snacks after take-off, as there was slight delay on the ground. Separately they served the meal, and again they did not disappoint. Topped it off with a Hagen-Das ice-cream. The price was reasonably good as I booked early. If you are particular about having good food on board, this airline is certainly for you.   Barcelona to Sao Paulo. First flight with Singapore Airlines and I was interested to see if travelling with Singapore would be substantially different to the experiences I had with AA/BA.  I flew economy but the service in economy with Singapore Airlines was equal to that in business class on AA. The Boeing 777 has a 3-3-3 layout so a bit more spacious for those in economy. We had the bassinet seats at the front as I was travelling with my wife and 3 month old daughter. Food was great, frequent drinks brought around as were snacks and fruit. In flight entertainment great.    Johannesburg to Taipei via Singapore return, and this is the 19th year I have flown with Singapore Airlines, and the standard and the quality of the airline has remained at a very high standard. We always get the seats I reserve for my brother and I, cabin crew friendly, food is very good, and seats are comfortable. Last time when I arrived at Taipei, I was informed (when I reached the baggage collection section) that my baggage didnt come through, it is at Singapore, and the airline said they will sort everything out for me, just need to leave a cellphone number and the address. I received my baggage the following day, which was very efficient. I recommend this airline.   Copenhagen to Singapore, returning from Singapore to London in business class on Singapore Airlines. Another top experience with SIA. The best business class seats for my 191 centimetres. Good champagne, good wines and pleasant crew. Good entertainment on new screens. And luggage on the belt when walking through no-queue automatic self immigration in Singapore.   Took this flight from Hong Kong to Singapore on a business trip. Nice and real business class in a bit of an older style. Service was great. While service and the cabin crew were nice, I was quite unhappy with the cockpit crew. Upon departure the pilot talked about fair weather conditions, nothing unusual. He did not mention with any word that we need to be seated for 2 hours and being shaken around in turbulence. It even got that bad that the captain got the cabin crew seated because he said it is too dangerous for them to walk around. But 5 minutes after that, the captain comes out to go to toilet? It is not a shame to tell passengers that there may be turbulence en route.   Flew Dubai to Melbourne via Singapore. I found the flight very enjoyable and on par with previous flights with Singapore Airlines. Check in on both the going and return trip was smooth and pleasant. The theme was reflected across the rest of the flight meaning at no point was I left feeling stressed or perturbed. I especially enjoyed the return flight from SIN to DXB since they had used a newly refurbished 777-300ER which had all the new bells and whistles, incl. touch screen IFE and refreshed seats. While I did not use the in-flight Wi-fi, it was good to know it was available and operating.   Singapore to Perth and return. We were pleasantly surprised to be greeted by name when we boarded the plane. Crew took time to make my kids feel comfortable on the flight. Cabin lights were turned off about an hour after the flight and then breakfast was served at about 4am. Unfortunately, my husband was taken ill shortly before landing Æ’?? thankfully there was a doctor sitting just across the aisle from him. The crew was amazing Æ’?? they thought and took care of every little detail. My kids and I were given assistance through the airport, and even helped into the taxi to go to the hospital. I didnÆ’??t manage to get anyoneÆ’??s names but I am very grateful for their assistance. SQ214: Again, impressed with service. Senior crew was outstanding, some junior crew seemed a bit indifferent. Seats on both flights were comfortable and acceptable for a medium haul flight (they were angled flat seats ie. old business class). For anything more than 7 hours, a full flat would be perfect. Selected breakfast from book-the-cook for SQ225 flight, which was delicious. IFE kept the kids entertained the whole time.   Sydney to Milan via Singapore with Singapore Airlines. A waste of money! Check-in took almost an hour. This was partly my fault as I was over the baggage allowance, although this had never been a problem with other airlines. The explanation was that SQ is strict with their baggage allowances - fair enough. However the amount of time it took was unacceptable. This resulted in having to rush through passport control and the TRS and left me with about 15- 20 minutes to quickly eat something before having to board the 4pm flight. The business class cabin was full of children. I had booked the flight 1 week prior and opted for the afternoon flight as the reservations agent had told me it was almost empty. I understand loads can change, but if I had known I would have opted for the evening flight even though this would have allowed only about 1 hour 30 minutes in Changi before catching the connecting flight. The food was inedible - my specially selected chef inspired meal of Tasmanian salmon was dry, with rubbery beans and overcooked pasta. The breakfast served just before landing in Milan was awful - two rubbery and cold poached eggs. There is no business class amenity kit provided - how cheap can an airline get? It just smacks of miserliness. I sent a formal complaint to Singapore Airlines and their lukewarm reponse was to say sorry. It is simply not good enough. Frankly, this airline has dramatically slipped. It can no longer be considered a top tier airline. The only saving grace is the personnel, who are exceptional. The business class lounge staff and most of the flight attendants were absolutely wonderful. However, this is not enough to redeem this airline. I take 3-4 long haul trips between Australia and Europe per year and will never fly Singapore Airlines again!   Flew from Singapore to Manila return. We got very good fares by booking several months in advance. The ground staff at the check-in counter at Manila airport was very friendly. Service by the senior crew on both flights were outstanding, the junior staff seemed a bit indifferent. There was a slight issue with my childs meal on the return flight (her meal contained pork, which we dont consume so it was exchanged for a seafood meal) which was taken care of by the crew once notified - happy with that service recovery. Everything else was as expected from Singapore Airlines. Seat was comfortable for the short flight, the IFE was great and kept the kids entertained.
   Brisbane - Singapore, the flight was smooth, the service was top notch, very professional from entry to exit, nothing was left unturned. It was a red eye flight but the cabin crew were still active throughout the cabin. This is why theyre sitting at second place in top 10 airlines in 2015. My only problems were the seat was kind of small for my size but that what you get for flying economy, the in-flight entertainment had a good selection of movies but the screen I felt wasnt clear in this day and age where HD is supreme and lastly the meal was smaller then I remember on my last Singapore Airlines flight 10 years ago. Overall highly recommended airline.   I booked a flight on Singapore Airlines on the 18 March 2016. I checked in at Manila NAIA Terminal 3 and the check in staff provided excellent Customer service. I was very pleased with the service provided by the cabin crew as they paid a lot of attention to the passengers needs. IFE needs to be updated to cater to the needs of passengers. I was unfortunate to experience the first generation IFE Tv monitor on my flight. I feel that the airline needs to upgrade their IFE to ensure passengers are well taken care of. I will definitely fly again with them!
   Excellent service, food, and entertainment options for this short 2.45 hour Singapore Airlines flight from Yangon to Singapore. Cabin crew were friendly, enthusiastic and professional. AVOD available, with a great selection of entertainment. Hot towels were served shortly after take-off, followed by a generous cooked lunch.    Flew economy on Singapore to Kuala Lumpur return this week. By chance, both flights used the new A350-900 fleet. For such short route, I guess its partly to test the new planes. Not too bad an experience on the new planes. Smooth, steady and quiet in the air, a beautiful looking plane especially the signature long and curvy wings and rather cool batman-looking cockpit window. Leg space is larger than other economy class.  Noisy wheel box and luggage compartment mechanisms (on both flights so its not a coincidence).  Insufficient aisle clearance as you pass through premium economy cabin so we had to literally hand carry our hand carry luggages at that stretch of the aisle. Noticed that cabin crew was struggling to find space to put hand carry bags into the overhead compartments.  Other than the beautiful outlook and smooth cruise in the air, the interior comfort falls short of expectations.   Dhaka to Melbourne via Singapore, flights operated by A330-300. Check in at Dhaka was fast and professional, the 3rd party lounge there was reasonable. Flight packed but crew were good. IFE good. Did not eat so cannot comment on food. Singapore to Melbourne with a professional crew, the flight was not full which meant crew were very relaxed. Good drink service and tasty food. Bags out in no time.    Melbourne to Delhi via Singapore. Check in fast and swift, and a good Lounge in Melbourne. A333 from MEL to SIN departed on time, and had plenty of room to spread around as flight was relatively empty. IFE good. Did not eat on this flight and cannot comment on food. Singapore lounge in Terminal 2 so so, and looks more like a canteen. SIN to DEL red eye operated by a Boeing 777-200 which was refitted. Packed flight and crew not as good. Food and IFE average.  Not bad flights but wont say they were very good either."
During-COVID, "Smooth check-in and outstanding service at the airport. The red-eye flight was delayed by 1,5 hour and at the gate SQ organised a buffet where one could get a hot meal, able to choose between vegetarian on with chicken. It was a very nice touch, was really impressed (especially comparing it to what you dont get from other airlines in similar circumstances). After boarding, very welcoming crew and for those still hungry there was the normal meal service with a round of drinks.   Nice flights, first leg got Premium Economy seat (but still normal Eco-Service) being SQ Gold. Nice hot meal as per the new concept for short flight with SQ. Long layover in SIN, could visit the new Silverkris Lounge and then onwards on SQs new 737max. Very comfortable plane, nice interacting crew and lovely dinner served, watching a good movie on their in flight entertainment!   Full flights, yet great service from a cheerful and engaged crew. The planes were spotless and comfortable, and the IFE selection was excellent - lots of new releases as well as plenty of art house movies. Sadly no pre-meal drinks run anymore though. And the food, whilst of good quality, seemed rather small and there wasnt that much on the tray; I also wished there were more Singaporean options available - because when there are, they are delicious. Toilets kept clean throughout the flight. Very good flights from a consistently good airline.   My initial flight was booked from Singapore to Darwin in April 2022. They cancelled my flight to Darwin for operational reasons and rebooked me after three days. I had to reach Australia earlier than rebooked date. I called the customer line and explained. They charged me to rebook me to a flight to Sydney as they had no other options available to fly me to Darwin. They did not give me a ticket from Sydney to Darwin and I lost a lot of money. Incompetent customer service staff and SQs attitude to their own cancellation was pathetic. The flight comfort was okay but a big decline in their overall customer care.    First flight on 26th April was a tatty 777-300. The saving grace was no passenger in the middle seat.  The carpet in the aisle was threadbare. The seating upholstery was no better, very scruffy. No fruit, no salad, no cheese & crackers and only one choice for breakfast. A cold roll was served but only butter to put on it, no conserves. No pre meal drink service. One beer or 1 glass of wine served with the meal. No wifi all flight. The in flight entertainment had to be rebooted 5 times. The crew were very good on this leg regularly passing through the cabin with water. SIN - BKK a more modern A350. I was looking forward to my 1st flight on an A350. The seats were thin with little support. Again the only saving grace was no centre seat occupant. The crew seemed to be in training with young people following older crew members around. I purposely selected Singapore Airlines for my flight following their pre-covid reputation at extra expense.   Very disappointing service from SIA. Plane was dirty departing SIN and staff communication was poor. Staff were curt to the point of thinly veiled rudeness. Lots of room for improvement here.   There were no welcome-drinks offered, no paper-menu available, no newspapers or magazines offered, Slippers, eye-shades and socks on request.  No tooth-brush- or shaving-kits in the washrooms, instead on request an amenity-kit containing a tooth-brush-set and a pair of socks. The quality and quantity of food is lowered significantly, with cold food items covered by plastic. The cheese plate is pre-packed with 2 tiny choices. I was lucky to get as a Solitaire PPS member a second one. There was not even a slice of lemon for a good glass of tea or a simple Gin Tonic available. Wines are  offered based on red or white. Only after request, the bottles are shown. Yet, any description of the taste and the drinking experience is Æ’?? thanks to the no menu. Same for food: no chance to enhancing your appetite by looking at the menu upfront, no chance to check quickly what kind of food you are enjoying right now because you need to open the digital menu Æ’?? which means you have to pause the movie you are watching, search for the meal menu to finally get to the description of dishes - I did not manage to find it. No pralines are offered after the main meal anymore. No Grand Marnier Cordon Rouge available any more. No hot towels to refresh after boarding, after the meal or sleep. Chocolate (e.g. Ferrero Rocher before) on the snack-selection was replaced by cheap no-name cookies, which comes in a see-through plastic-container. The silver-kris-magazine available online only. The internet-connectivity was poor on this flight and did not work for more than 50% of the flight-time.  Significant lower services and amenities for a significantly higher price.  We had a very unpleasant experience with Singapore Airlines. We have originally purchased our ticket to India from Auckland to Delhi and from Delhi to Auckland via Melbourne, leaving on the 9th of April and coming back on the 24th of April. We have received an email on 11th of February that our flight SQ4235 has been cancelled from Melbourne to Auckland. We have contacted the call centre and tried to rebook our flight. We choose the option of rebooking on 31st of May from Delhi to Auckland via Singapore so we have less transfers, flight number SQ403 and SQ4281 operated by Air New Zealand. The call centre operator informed us that all the economy tickets were sold on those flights, so we have an option to purchase Premium Economy tickets by paying an extra $937.60 NZD. We were charged this amount on 6th of March. We were excited to come back to Auckland and for first time in our life in Premium Economy. Unfortunately, our excitement was totally crushed when we realized we can only board the plane in economy class upon check in online. We have tried to contact the call centre again but were unable to get hold on an operator 3 times (we totally understand the current circumstances). The Delhi Airport staff were lovely but were unable to upgrade our tickets. We dont mind Economy tickets as we normally would not upgrade our flights but, in this case, we had no other choice and were charged an extra amount for nothing.    5 star for flight attendants, always friendly and helpful. The A350 seats are thin and hard. Boarding process was very unorganised.  Quality of my food was terrible. SilverKris lounge at Changi airport was chaotic, impossible to find a seat.   My recent flights with Singapore airlines were some of the worst travel experiences I have had. We have been unable to travel to New Zealand for almost 3 years due to the pandemic. As borders were finally open we booked flights with Singapore Airlines, which were more expensive than any other airline, thinking spending more money would be worth it after such a long wait .. how wrong were we! Our outbound flight, SQ 305 on 17 March 2022 from London to Singapore was delayed by 1 hour and 53 minutes, which led to us being unable to make our connection flight to Auckland, SQ 281 on 18 March 2022. They then had a technical fault also and the flight was further delayed, causing our missed connection time to Auckland. The staff onboard the plane had no idea what was going to happen, and even though most of the aircraft had connections to make, they gave us no information and were incredibly unhelpful. Once we arrived in Singapore, it was an even worse state of affairs. We were greeted by a makeshift desk with everyone scrambling to give out new tickets (there were literally hundreds of people with missed connections). We were told we had missed our flight, and the next connection was 14 hours away. No food vouchers, no hotel rooms offered. We were told all the airport hotels were booked, however we walked to and managed to get a room, at our own cost. The next flight was also packed, and even though my partner and I had paid extra money for seats together, the new plane was unable to accommodate this and we had to sit separately. My partner has food intolerances, and none of his meals was catered for on the next 10-hour-long flight. He was offered some crisps and that was all for the entire flight. We honestly could not believe how bad the whole journey had been and arrived in Auckland completely and utterly exhausted. A really bad start to a trip we had been looking forward to for such a long time. On our return flight, we luckily made our connection. I would say the meals and customer service have gone downhill and it did not feel like we were traveling on a premium airline. Since being home, we have complained to Singapore Airlines and asked for a refund/compensation for our outward flight and the hotel we had to pay for. However, they claim it is not their fault and is refusing any refunds.   Since COVID, Singapore Airlines service has been going down and prices going up, Phnom Penh to Paris which was approximately between 2800 and 3300$ is now around 5 to 6000$. They dont give any more amenity kits or we may have to ask? Also, they do not propose anymore any drinks like Champagne before taking off. The lounge quality is also not like before, I presume Covid is an excuse for everything but we are still paying the price so what? We should accept it I presume. The quality of the company service is clearly going down, I hope they will improve that for going back to their best but before reading that they are I will certainly try another company to see the difference.   I have flown SQ many times but I feel the standards are dropping. Contacting customer service was impossible. Call back takes about 3 working days. No issue with check in. Boarding as expected. The lounge in Singapore is very disappointing. Poor selection food, over crowded, reasonable service.  On flight service is ok, efficient but not warm. Seats are good but dated. Food above average but no welcome drink or towel. I was ignored during the long 13h flight unless you ask for help. DonÆ’??t get me wrong, SQ is still above average but losing ground fast. They need to buck up. Start by improving customer service, donÆ’??t keep us waiting for hours for a reply on CHAT.   The check-in process at JFK was the worst check-in experience Ive experienced. I was waiting for check-in for over 2 hours. The line just didnt move at all. The agent was extremely inefficient. I was one of the last customers to check in and it was about 30 minutes before the departure time. The counter agents was escorting a group of last-to-check-in customers to the security checkpoint so they could skip the line (we were late) and somehow I was the only one who left in the security line on my own. The service on board was terrible despite the high-regarded in-flight service that Singapore Airlines is usually known for. The service was so slow for a flight with only 160 customers.  I sat at one of the single seat toward the end of the aircraft and the steward kept bumping into me like I was sitting on the aisle. He didnt even apologize. My food was OK at best. The worst part was probably the lavatories. Truly disgusting, trash was everywhere on the floor.    My wife and I booked a ticket to Manila from London. A few weeks after we booked we received an e-mail that very clearly stated that we could upgrade to Business class and showed a price We jumped at it and booked. We got an email saying we were upgraded on the 2nd leg from Singapore to Manila. I called and was told we were not upgraded on the London Manila leg as Business class was full. I told the CS rep that we did not need Business class for a 3 hour flight and requested a refund, the lady went to ask her supervisor who then told us company policy was no refunds. We went from being a happy customer to a very unhappy one. The food was the same as all other airlines, nothing memorable. The in flight staff were great. We are disabled. Very average service. Much better on our usual carrier, Qatar Airways. We had a bad experience 7 years ago with SQ and swore never to fly them again. I wish we had kept to that decision.    The SQ system can almost never get mileage accrual nor ticket changes right. I have called them 29 times in the last 12 months and the contact number has an average waiting time of just over 1 hour.  I wasted so much time with them on the line. The service has been downgraded so much. Most amenities are gone. My food was of very low quality and Book the chef is mostly not available (even if they claim they are on the website).   I just had the worst experience at Paris CDG Airport. Their baggage weight policies are insane.  I was in Nairobi then Paris coming from NY. Decided to extend through Singapore heading to Hanoi. I have been allowed 50lbs (about 23kgs) by every airline but Singapore Airlines only allow 30 kgs total and they tried to charge me $700 for about 16 extra kgs. I ended up arguing with them and took some stuff out of my and stuck it in my jacket and carry on.    There was no water or juice served for one and half hours which was ridiculous. Food serving was chaotic as crew moving back wards and forwards in a disorganised fashion. We ordered Hindu non veg meal and ordered meal were missing from the cabin crew list. Quantity of my food was horrific. Service was all over the place and chaotic. When I questioned they said there are 30 kids travelling on a full flight.    The aircraft and the crew are so nice. People are helpful and very kind. But the customer service is honestly the worst Ive ever seen. Impossible to change my booking online. I was in Thailand impossible to contact them. They do not answer mails or phone. I would never fly again with them.   Flew today 5th April 2022 on the 1500  flight and the cabin crew were more than fantastic! They were very kind, helpful and caring. I would definitely travel with them again as this was one of the best experiences Ive had. Well done SQ and keep up the good work!   My wife and me were on our holiday trip to USA and taken SQ32 on 31/3 in SIA business Class seat 15D & F. We are happy with the check in and boarding. It was very smooth although there were COVID 19 documents to verify. Crew on board was cheerful and helpful. The soup does not taste peppery at all. This need to improve as Singaporeans will not like this. I had chicken rice and the rice was super nice with the chillie. The chicken could have been better with abit more flavour. The appetizers (salmons & prawns) were nice. Like the cheese and biscuits as well. When we were ask which red wine we would like to have, IÆ’??ve chosen the Barrosa red wine because I am familiar with it. At the initial stage suggest that the stewardess could have just recommend one of them since I was indecisive on which red wine to choose from. When I asked about any arrival and custom forms to fill in. A few of the steward and stewardess told us it is now done online but when we arrived the SFO ground staff told us there is no requirement for now to fill out any forms. SIA need to update their cabin crew about this as this was a bit of worry for me as I have not been to USA for 10 years.  Not the cabin crewÆ’??s fault for this. Overall the cabin crew team on board were cheerful and helpful. We totally enjoy the flight in business class especially my wife as this is her first time in business class and she enjoy the new business class seat a lot as she was I totally worried that she could not sleep but the food down seat converted to bed was comfortable for her to sleep in.   MAN-SIN-SYD-SIN-MAN earlier this month was my first long-haul flights since before the pandemic. IÆ’??ve always loved Singapore Airlines, and I still do. Generally, a very friendly service, although I felt that the cabin crew on the MAN-SIN leg were a bit less so. I wondered if this might be due to travel fatigue after laying over from IAH on the fourth of four sectors. In-flight catering was my big issue with SQ on this trip. The flight time from MAN-SIN-MAN is longer due to the war in Ukraine and Russian airspace being closed - I reckon at least two hours more. I was a bit frustrated that the two meals were on opposite ends of that 14 hours. The lack of a printed menu (due to Covid - which I couldnÆ’??t understand as these have always been printed and distributed fresh anyway) meant that half way through the first 14 hours I actually paid for a bit of internet access, so I could see what refreshments were on offer (it was supposed to be free to do this, but I couldnÆ’??t work it out - although in hindsight, I should have just asked!). I was so hungry - the meals, refreshment and alcohol servings were just way too small. Entertainment is great, and the upgrade IFE since I last flew SQ a while back was nice. Seating in Economy is good (always nice to have three of four legs with a free seat next to me), although one the A380 the seat angle was very far back - some people like that, I didnÆ’??t. While not quite the uber luxurious SQ of days gone by, I still think they are a great airline. Just fix up the catering, especially.   A350 from Melbourne to Singapore was in regional configuration and unsuitable for a nearly 8 hour flight. My seat was hard and there are too many in the business class section. Food served to me was in microscopic proportions and there was no drink on boarding. I waited 90 mins for first refreshment. A380 upper deck has many business class seats, some of the windows are obscured, my seat was rock hard though it was bigger and with more storage than previous flight. Long delay to my getting refreshments. Long delay to serving food. I got the impression that there are too many business class seats on the A380 for good service to be possible. In transit at Changi the Krisflyer lounge was packed with nowhere to sit and overheated.   Singapore to Male, no inflight entertainment or even music. No towels, no appetiser and no choice of meal. Coffee/tea was not offered to me. After takeoff 1 toilet was locked for the entire flight until before landing. That usable toilet was filthy after an hour. When booking this route there are 2 flights a day both the same price but the night flight is operated by the A350 which has inflight entertainment. The day flight i took did not. Why the difference when the ticket price is the same? The website should prompt the user that this flight has no entertainment. No smiles no friendliness. Whatever happened to the Singapore Girl and A Great Way To Fly?  First time on SQ business for a very long time so we were excited to see what it was like especially during COVID. Compared to the Qatar the hard product is not as good especially the Q suite. The book the cook worked well with course by course service with the chicken satay as amuse bush. Meal was excellent by any standard as was the service. Where they went above and beyond was when my 2 year old son was feeling unwell, they assisted more than I would ever have hoped for. Flight was a bit more turbulent than normal due to the different route to avoid Russia and the Ukraine. The flight landed late due to a headwind. Luggage was out by the time we cleared immigration. Only downside was the lack of a touchscreen and selection of shows was not as good as I remembered.   Osaka Kansai to Singapore. There werent many people on the flight, the check was smooth, no queue. As well as you can tell on how many people were waiting in the boarding room. Funny story the airline website indicate the plane were full where you cant select another economy seats, and pushes you choose at the end of the tail close to lavatory. Even when youre boarded the plane when clearly no people, they werent let you sit on the same economy coach that were empty. I have to asked 3 times to asked them to move my seat (where less than 50 people on that flight) in such a big plane, which eventually they did it. Nonetheless I still enjoyed this midnight flight and had the whole row for myself.   Bali Denpasar to Tokyo Narita via Singapore. I was looking forward to flight with SQ after a while. Although the current situation due to global pandemic got me bit worried to kept flying for this holiday. Since it wasnt a cancelled flight/ route, I decided to carry on. The flight for DPS-SIN were rather full and I enjoyed their Boeing 787. It was a short flight and dinner were served during the flight was delightful. We had a quick layover in Singapore for my connecting flight to Tokyo with A380. I sat on lower deck and the plane was merely full. They gave us light meal before turndown service, however a mistake was made by the cabin crew as they gave me a wrong food that am allergic too (Ive never requested). I got sick during the flight. They kept apologise to me and one of the senior crew came to approach. They offered me a doctor service upon arrival in Narita which I refused. I got slightly better, but it shouldnt be happen. Despite of the allergic reaction due to their service, overall I was still able to enjoy the trip. It was just hindering me to give them a perfect score.   15th March I was meant to fly back to Sydney from Amsterdam. I was visiting family and friends and with COVID-19 I found it hard to leave. I was checked in but later that day read on the Singapore website that you werent allowed to enter Singapore airport if youve been to Germany in the last 14 days. I did. I went through Germany for wintersport to Austria just beforey, so I cancelled my flight. I received 83 euros back (which hardly covers my flight) and I didnt have a choice of accepting that money or not. I just got it back. I tried to contact the airline many times about the situation and never got a reply. Now theyre saying they cant help me because I already received 83 euro back for my cancellation. Whereas I know and shouldve had the right to receive flight credits instead for a flight back to Sydney.    Osaka to Bangkok via Singapore booked for March 20th. Singapore Airlines does not give you full refunds or vouchers should they decide. In my case they stated that they have adopted a new travel restriction earlier than the Thailand government required and, thus, would have to seek some other transport. Today 03.04 they also confirmed a hefty cancellation/no-show fee would be deduced.    Da Nang to Perth via Singapore. Had to bring my flights home forward by 2 days due to border shutdowns and Government advice re corona virus. Charged me an extra $520AUD to do so despite having a far longer layover in Singapore. Claim that there is no rebooking charge, but there was a fare difference.   Due to the corona virus out break we decided to travel home 6 days early out of a 28 day holiday in Penang, we contacted SIA regarding a change to our flight who informed us we would have to pay 1350RM per person a total of 2700RM. After booking the flight we received an email saying the flight was cancelled with no explanation other than to ring one of there offices in Penang or KL this was at 18.15 there offices close at 17.30. I feel that Singapore Airlines are taking advantage of passengers trying to return home how can they justify charging customers for wanting to return home early. My opinion is 2700RM was an exorbitant price to have pay for a change to flights tickets also the both flights had spare seats when we boarded the flights. We will be returning to Penang when this crises is over but as frequent flyers on Singapore Airlines we will be looking at other airlines.   Melbourne to Koh Samui via Singapore. Our flights home were cancelled via email a week ago. Supposed to be flying home today. Email stated that we could get in touch via online form, which has taken days and hours to get to actually work. Email response said that they would get in touch shortly, so far nothing. Wont give refund so that we can source other options, only credit for future flights. Unreachable via phone. Cant log on to site at all now. Phone number states not in service. I understand they must be overwhelmed with queries, but feeling totally abandoned and just want a refund so I can find another way home.   Melbourne to Singapore. This was our first time flying Premium Economy and my expectation was for Singapore Airlines was to provide an exceptional experience. Firstly the boarding in Melbourne was good, the ground and cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Plenty of legroom and nice comfortable seats. Noise-cancelling headphones were supplied although my wife had to ask for them as they werent at her seat. The back of the seat in front was a bit grubby and I used an antiseptic wipe to clean it, there were some other grubby bits around the armrest and tray table. Champagne was offered and gratefully accepted. The meal service was prompt although it was just an economy meal. I was hoping for something a little better as I paid double the economy ticket price. Wine was offered however only one red and one white, I dont like Sauvignon Blanc and that was the only white. I did ask the flight attendant for a Chardonnay and she was very obliging and managed to find a glass for me. Big Plus! The flight was comfortable and the crew were outstanding. It makes a difference when the crew are customer-focused. Overall a good experience. Two things, ditch the Sauvignon Blanc and provide an upgraded Premium Economy meal.   Jakarta to Singapore. I reschedule my flight the following day as day after is the lock down. I Top up more money for the ticket. I was confirmed on the morning 9.20am flight. However I received a email that evening that my flight for the next day morning was cancelled. Immediately there was no line, only you got to email. I have no choice but make it the next day for the night flight 20.20.  And true enough that morning there isnt any public transport, no taxi that day. I get the Hotel reception to assist. Upon check & reaching home, I learnt to appreciate our Singapore Airlines. They did it. I feel secure upon reaching the Jakarta Airport. A big thank you to Singapore Airlines. .   Auckland to Zurich via Singapore. The cabin staff were fantastic. Courteous, helpful, friendly & professional. Unlike Swissair, who did the Zurich to Heathrow bit on 28 February for me & Singapore to Heathrow bit for my wife on 20 March. Disappeared for most of the flight, discourteous to the point of rudeness, not at all bothered.    Tokyo Haneda to Melbourne via Singapore. Due to the coronavirus crisis I had to bring my flight forward by five weeks. Once I got through to it, the call centres staff were efficient in getting me suitable flights. Check-in at Haneda was friendly and quick. The ANA lounge was comfortable with a great view of the runway, although food and drink options were limited due to antivirus precautions. The Singapore lounge was very spacious with a good variety of food and drink choices. Onboard both flights the seats were very comfortable and the service was impeccable. My Chinese-style vegetarian meal on the first leg was very tasty, but the Indian-style vegetarian meal on the second leg was not as impressive, with little curry and a lot of bread. There were several drinks rounds on both flights. I managed to get a good sleep on a comfortable long bed. Both flights arrived slightly early. All in all, an excellent experience.   Zurich to Melbourne via Singapore booked ages ago. Now with all the travel bans/restrictions due to Corona virus I needed to cancel the three tickets we booked. I cannot reach a ticketing agent on the phone, answering machine tells you to ring again. and again, again to no avail. The ticketing office in Zurich has been shut for a week with a leaflet on the door telling you, you guessed it the number where no-one is home.  I sent an online form to which I got an email telling me that they will respond after 7 working days, that means they will get back to me after my scheduled flight would have taken place.  Flew economy Sydney to Singapore day flight. Very happy and a pleasant flight. Had a row of seats to myself. The A380 cabin was clean and did not look to be very old at all. Range of entertainment options was great. 2 meals served and had vegetarian which were both fine. Plenty of water offered and the crew were polite and professional. Despite news to the contrary, there were hot towels and blankets and pillows!   Phuket to Singapore, unusually fly by SQÆ’??s sister company Silkair. Happy to fly on their wide body Boeing 777-200 which offer a better product. I find the seats on their old B777-200 more comfortable and better padded than their newer planes. The food and crew were amazing. Overall a great way to fly."
Post-COVID, "Flight was amazing. The crew onboard this flight were very welcoming, and gave a good atmosphere. The crew serving my aisle goes by the initial G. She was very kind & helpful. Gave my mom a bday cake for a late celebration even though it was just a 1hr 45min flight. Seat is well sanitized, legroom is spacious. IFE onboard has many variety of shows, music, etc. Bathroom always kept clean by crew at all times. & Food was delicious, overall this flight is a 9/10   For my final trip booked for July 2024, Singapore cancelled my return flight from Istanbul to Sydney. Both the travel agent and I have been trying to get in touch via phone, sms and online forms and they are not responding at all. The travel agent no longer wants to know after a month and a half of trying, they sent me an email for me to try direct, Singapore will not speak to me despite my telling them the agent has wiped his hands of it. Today I found out I will not get my full refund if I were to cancel because the agent took out travel insurance on my behalf without advising me at all. I always have my own travel insurance why would I need another.   I initially booked two separate flights for this airline in November. The first was a LHR-SIN-LHR flight and another was a SIN-MNL-SIN flight. To cut the story short, I requested to rebook my LHR-SIN flight two weeks ahead of my scheduled flight due to a family bereavement and I needed to be in the Philippines. Despite my personal situation, I received an amazing support from the Customer Service team, who happily reorganised my flight, connected my 2 flight bookings so I can get to Manila on time, and without rebooking fees. At the London airport, I was sent-off warmly by the ground staff who has empathised with me as I check-in and ensure I was boarded comfortably in the plane. These gestures of goodwill and support made me grateful for Singapore Airlines. Even though I am no longer based in Singapore, I will always find a way to fly with them. Thank you. These words are never enough for the outstanding, grateful and sincere help you have provided me.   We booked our ticket well in advance for our return trip from India from CCU to Perth via Singapore and after few days SIA changed the flight timing later, from originally scheduled 7.40am to 7.20am. We boarded the flight from CCU and flight landed 1 minute before time. Upon landing we have received the notification that our flight has been rescheduled and it will depart at 9.30am. As mentioned before we booked well in advance and paid extra money for forward seats. However with utter surprise we have noticed that they have allocated us three different seats that too rear of the aircraft. While contacting the Transfer desk the customer service lady told us it is not possible to provide us any other seats so that three of us can seat together. She was very rude and not suitable for this kind of job. Being a Krisflyer Gold member this is very disappointing and not at all expected from SIA.    We made a Phuket-Singapore round trip which was exemplary, from punctuality to welcome, including the food and drinks offered (Business Class). On the other hand, wishing to make a new reservation, it was impossible to pay online, as I had done previously, and despite around ten calls directly to Singapore (but visibly diverted to other call centers). The employees have nothing to do with it, they follow a protocol, but after 6 hours of attempts, I still havent been able to pay my ticket. Deficient reservation system, friendly employees but very limited in their knowledge of their reservation system, impossible to reach a manager and promise of a solution in 72 hours. A real shame for an expensive company that claims to be among the best in the world. Nous avons fait un aller-retour Phuket-Singapore qui ??tait exemplaire, de la ponctualit??  laccueil, en passant par les mets et boissons offerts ( Classe affaire ). Par contre, souhaitant effectuer une nouvelle r??servation, impossible de payer en ligne, comme je lavais fait pr??c??demment, et malgr?? une dizaine dappels directement  Singapour ( mais visiblement d??vi??s sur dautres centrales dappel ). Les employ??s ny sont pour rien, ils suivent un protocole, mais apr??s 6 heures de tentatives, je nai toujours pas mon pu payer mon billet. Syst??me de r??servation d??ficient, employ??s sympathique mais tr??s limit??s dans leurs connaissance de leur syst??me de r??servation, impossible datteindre un responsable et promesse dune solution dans..... 72 heures. Une v??ritable honte pour une compagnie ch??re qui se pr??tend parmi les meilleures du monde.   Book early coming 2024 ticket suppose SQ101 launching JunÆ’??24 and now received email say SQ101 is not operating due to operational reason. They suggest swapping my itinerary to one day earlier to SQ127 result long layover time in SIN and aircraft change from Boeing 737-8 to Boeing 737-800NG for real was ex-MI aircraft.  The flight was delayed for almost 4 hours. The flight was supposed to be 605pm but only departed at about 950pm. It was only informed to us after we checked in and completed our immigration customs check. We have to wait for so many hours in the restricted areas. We booked this airline only instead of budget airlines only because we thought their flights is known to be punctual. But we were wrong. Moreover, the meal provided is a slice of pizza and exactly the same as the meal that was provided when we took the flight from Singapore to Penang. We are expecting at least some changes in the meal. This is really disappointing, that such arrangement is coming from a world class top airlines. There were also no instructions in the flight or emails to instruct you how to get the wifi service up. There was also no inflight entertainment system or even an earpiece for audio music.   Book the cook worked well, my seatmate got economy food. There was a bottle of water in every seat, good wifi connectivity. Wines are offered. Frankfurt to Singapore as I moved my seat to bulkhead 25 hours before flying, somehow this messes up the book the cook. So I had eco food. They were apologetic and I received voucher to redeem. I slept better than in economy, and I didnt have swollen leg! I used to try to score business class seat in flights > 10 hours due to my leg tends to swell. But prices now are horrendously expensive. Singapore Airlines premium economy already good enough for my leg.   The customer service is a nightmare. I have spent days on the phone since I booked my flight 2 months ago. I booked a flex fare to be able to reschedule my flight but the homepage is not working - same as the staff on the phone that tells me a different story about why I cannot reschedule every time.  Never again.   No inflight entertainment at all. Yes, we are talking about Singapore Airlines. Please send your staff to rate the flight from Singapore to Penang, during my flight from Penang to Singapore, the entire aircraft is super hot. I am wondering is sq providing a free sauna to their passengers during seating until the flight takes off, only then do they provide air conditioning. Dont just rate their long distance flight. Please go ahead and try out their short distance. They do have WIFI on, but unusable.   The experience was very good on both Outbound to Inbound flights. As we travelled Premium Economy we received priority boarding which was good especially as we were travelling with my 80 year old dad. Premium Economy is very good especially the Leg room, which is the main reason I wanted it and being over double some economy fares it satisfied our needs. Extra recline also made a difference and was bearable even when the person in front was reclining. The Premium Economy cabin only has 4 rows 2-4-2 and is separated from the main economy cabin which made it feel more spacious. We chose the back row so nobody behind us made it feel a little more private and a big gap between us and exit room economy in the next cabin. Flight was smooth and comfortable Staff were great. Helpful and very accommodating when needed. Food was good although had the option to Book the Cook prior to flight. I know some airlines are starting to increase leg room to 40 inches SIN (38) which would be great when you consider the extra money that is paid. On our return from Croatia at Frankfurt there were flight delays which meant we would miss our connection from SIN MEL But both Lufthansa an Singapore Airlines made this a much less stressful experience, in fact a great little adventure. At FRA we received meal vouchers and were updated regularly by helpful staff and when we arrived in SIN everything was organised as soon as we got of the plane. Meal vouchers, hotel vouchers, Taxi to hotel and back, assistance with getting our entry visa on arrival. Choose a good airline and the combo of Lufthansa and especially flying major legs with Singapore Airlines made it an easy, comfortable experience. I would highly recommend.   We flew on SQ285 on 22/11/23 - great flight and service from the pilot to the hostesses. In the terminal we were blessed with the assistance on Punitha Maniam checking us in who spotted an issue with one of our NZ visas. Punitha took the trouble to re-apply on an express approval application on our behalf including follow up phone calls to ensure we had approval. Punitha thank you so much for being you and helping us as I am sure you would for all your customers. Above and beyond the only way to describe you!    Flight delayed out of Singapore. Luggage didnÆ’??t make it on the flight. Said it would be delivered the next day! It has not! IÆ’??m completely canceling plans tomorrow to go 3 hrs round trip to get luggage myself, as I fly back to the states the next day. For being called the best airline in the world, I have experienced the most irresponsible service. They said they would do one thing and they have not followed through.  I used Singapore Airlines on 10 flights during September and October between the UK and different Asian destinations, I have used Singapore many times maintaining Kris flyer Gold Status for some years. During my recent flights I used economy, premium economy and business class, the flights were okay nothing spectacular but probably the biggest take away was the poor service on just about every flight apart from 1. Ranging from missed food to dreadful food, just not the Singapore Airlines I know! I used SQ for the consistency of service which is not after COVID not the same, I know many airlines have suffered from experience leaving the work place, but Singapore crew service and consistency are its trade mark. I travel to South East Asia a lot from both Europe & South Africa so Singapore figured in my travel plans a lot, I will probably use them again in the future but in the meantime I have gone to an alternative for my next round of flights. I would recommend Singapore on some routes simply because the competition is poor.  We had the most horrific check-in experience with Singapore Airlines on Nov. 7th flight SQ 25 from JFK to Frankfurt. The check-in area barely had any travelers when we arrived and we were greeted by an agent immediately. The horror began. Our ticket was a one-way ticket since we were going to Split, Croatia (our final destination) for a longer time period for us and, especially, our toddler boy (29 months old traveling with me and my wife of course) to enjoy time with family and friends. Therefore, we purchased an airline ticket for each of us and chose Singapore Airlines as a well-respected travel provider. Each of us had 2 check-in luggage, one carry-on, one backpack, and a car seat for our son. Leaving for an extended period of time with toddlers requires carrying a lot of luggage and we carefully packed it all, measured it, and tried to pay for extra weight online before flying. There was no option for it. As I was taking care of our son, my wife was checking us in at the counter (the first class counter right next to the business class counter in Row 8). I noticed that she became visibly distressed and that the agent was on the phone holding off the check-in procedure. I asked if everything was ok and she responded that the check-in agent was not letting us check in. What he and his supervisor who he was on the phone with, and who seemed to be a business class agent right next to us, said equals absolute harassment and a complete overstepping of their boundaries. They proceeded to tell us that we needed to purchase a separate return ticket each because we wonÆ’??t be let in to stay in Croatia. This is unheard of, absolutely wrong, and untrue, a situation created by the agent and his supervisor that doesnÆ’??t exist. I am Croatian and an American citizen, and my wife and my son are American citizens who can enter Croatia with American passports as they wish. Then, the agent (still on the phone with the next counter supervisor) asked my wife if she had at least $8000 and after taking my Croatian passport said it would be fine for me but not for my wife who never changed her name - so was asked to produce proof of our marriage. Thankfully she carries our marriage certificate in case of this but for other countries as we travel - not for the US! And this interrogation happened in an atmosphere of hostility where the agent and his supervisor, who at some point was having a laughing chat with one of his colleagues, behaved with utmost disrespect towards us as their/your client/customer. Zero courteous smile. Zero understanding. Zero any sort of empathy that we have a toddler with us. We knew that we would pay for extra weight in one piece of luggage (the 9 kg option we couldnÆ’??t do online). They proceeded to make us check our two carry-ons that were barely over 7kg (and this has never happened to me or my wife in our 25 years of global flying) at a cost of $700. The Crew and flight were great. The food was horrible and the seats were not too comfy. Also, the customer service was almost ignorant of our complaint and defended their agents actions without any understanding. Never again Singapore Airlines.   Just a short 2 hour flight. Food was excellent - had the Pre-Order Butter Chicken. Staff were efficient. Comfy seat but no time to relax back and enjoy. No issues and would fly again.    An excellent experience. Food was simply terrific (Pan Seared Salmon) and plenty of Drink on offer. Service was Friendly and Efficient. I got a good 7 hours of sleep laid out flat. Also used their complimentary WiFi without any issues.  We were booked on Business from Johannesburg to Singapore in October and was asked to provide the credit card used to purchase the ticket for my husbandÆ’??s ticket some 11 months ago. Apparently this was flagged by SQ system at checkin and we need to provide said credit card for checkin staff to scan into SQ system in order to allow us to get his boarding pass. Otherwise we need to sign an indemnity form or risk denied boarding. Fortunately, I did have the credit card used 11 months ago when I booked his flight or both of us would end up in Johannesburg stranded! Reason offered: 1. Fraud detection systems picked this up based off determined parameters. When I challenged this because 11 months SQ would have been paid in full and their ERP system should have the information. 2. Next explanation: within a 12- hour period we charged many transactions on card. When I provided the data which showed we never charged anything within 12 hour either before or after . 3. Their system algorithm is correct in picking this up as fraud and good for customer! Empty assurance of prevention when SQ has not provided any explanation how this event was picked up! I am still waiting for someone more senior to pick this upÆ’?? Interested to ensure that this will not happen to any other passengers who booked tickets at least 3 months in advance of travel date let alone one year ago!   Very poor service, was told not to take my cabin luggage onto business class, but all the bags in the plane including economy were bigger. Cabin crew brought the wrong dinner and basically told me to eat it, only replaced when I did not. Seat not able to got flat, very poor seating configuration for someone over 6Æ’??.   The best airline Ive flown. The windows shades are automatic dark, automatic colors. The aircraft is big with many lavatories. Wifi is working for Krisflyer members and its free. The IFE is also working with great choices of movies and tv shows and a usb port provided. The breakfast was also great.   We were booked in on seat numbers 62j to 62k as a family of four. At the time of the meals, when requested for a chicken meal we were only offered an option of fish or vegetarian. As there was no chicken available, my kids were given a fish meal that they could not eat. I refused a meal, as I was unable to get a chicken meal. What I was given to understand by the head stewardess that there were not enough meals on the flight. What baffles me is how can the earlier economy seats in the plain get what they want, and we as a family in the latter half were not even given one chicken meal. No where on check-in were we given an option to choose our meals too. Even the head stewardess was of the opinion there was an issue with the allocation of meals.    They never placed my 2 bags on my flights from Rome to Singapore and onto Penang. I have airtags and the app shows exactly where they are and Singapore Airlines refuses to use this information and continues to tell me that they cannot find my luggage. I am stranded in Penang with only the clothes on my back. They have completely destroyed this travel experience. I attach a pic of where my bags currently are at Rome airport!   Seats that we paid for and confirmed very much earlier had been unfairly re-assigned later on to another person who was their preferred customer without first obtaining our consent or approval; SIA customer service initially informed us the seat was re=assigned due to flight schedule change but it turned out to be false. When they realized, they were wrong, they subsequently changed their position to cancellation and re-booking of our flight by their customer service agents. We did not cancel the flight but it was an error committed by their customer agent. . When the customer service agent re-booked our flight they ensured us that our original seats selection would be the same. We periodically checked with the customer service agents to ensure that our original seats selection were intact. They confirmed and re-confirmed that our original paid seats were unchanged. We also went on to their on-line booking website to confirm that our original seat selections remained intact. On checking in (2 days before flight), we discovered that one of our paid seats was re-assigned to another customer without our prior knowledge and approval. We discovered our seat was re-assigned to a standard seat to the back of the plane. Immediately. we called the customer service agents immediately on the phone to reinstate our paid seats back but they refused to do it. The customer service agents on the phone did not converse well in English and they gave us all the wrong information about the seat change. It was extremely difficult to get through to them on the phone and we had to wait for a long time before we could speak to someone.  The duty manager at airport informed us our paid seat had been changed last minute due to a preferred customer had kicked us out due to his importance. It was unprofessional and unethical for them to do that. We had to fight and argue fervently all the way through at each encounter. Even at the gate, we had to fight and argue to get our seat back after seeking approval from the preferred customer. Escalated the complaints to the senior management (CEO) several times who did not even respond to our complaints.. Actual costs incurred to resolve the airline mistakes amounted to SGD429.65 and they only agreed to issue a voucher of SGD75 which is inadequate to compensate for the actual costs incurred. Moreover, it does not include the additional inherent cost of lost vacation time and stress/frustrations to deal with their mistakes that they had created for us unnecessarily. Customer service investigation focused mainly on the outcome but do not provide fair customer resolution to their mistakes they had committed. The last response received from the customer service agent was that they are happy with the investigation and no further communication and action would be taken i.e. refused to address their mistakes committed and refused to compensate the costs that we had incurred.   It was a good flight. I would have given a full 10 on 10 review but because of the seats I aint that satisfied. Business class seats should have been more comfortable when travelling long haul flights.  Having flown with a few middle east carriers throughout this route, definitely I was putting a high expectations from this SQ flight. Got the best price compare with another middle eastern carriers with extra 300 AED for extra 5kgs checked in luggage. The check in process was smooth and I was lucky enough to get upgraded to premium eco seat from SIN to CGK. The DXB to SIN flight was really bumpy, but the crew was really courteous and helpful throughout the flight. The food was definitely better than the middle eastern carriers and also free wifi was a nice touch comparing to any other airlines. The service was feel more special on SIN to CGK sector though it was a very short flight. Definitely will choose this again (if the price is right, compare to middle eastern carriers). Good job SQ.   There was nothing special at Frankfurt airport pre-departure. It was good when we got onboard. The seat on SQ 777-300ER is similar to that on the A350-900ULR, meaning it is spacious and comfortable. Catering from Frankfurt was excellent, and I liked all the dishes served, especially the satay (I heard the satay was brought from Singapore, but I was not sure). Cabin crew were very nice and helpful, as expected from SQ.   The airlines check-in staff charged me an extra $200 for a 10kg backpack, just slightly over the 7kg carry-on limit. This experience was incredibly frustrating and inflexible.     Although the aircraft is good with flat beds and the crew is good, the onboard selection of entertainment does not compare to other airlines. The meals are low quality for Business class. Also I find the seats not as comfortable as others.    I have never come across a company that would ask a customer to pay a penalty fee for switching from a cheaper to a more expensive service. I bought a one way Economy class ticket from the US to Singapore at first, planning to take another airline for the other leg of the trip. Being a loyal customer of Singapore Airlines, I decided to be more generous and pay a lot more to buy a 2-way Business class trip in place for the original one-way Economy class ticket. I cancelled the one-way Economy class ticket after buying the 2-way Business class ticket and found that Singapore Airlines charged me a cancellation fee of US$200. I called Singapore Airlines and wrote to ask for the US$200 cancellation fee to be waived and refunded. The experience was a nightmare and the response was shocking to a long time customer. It took a long time to get through the hotline. My request for refund was rejected with no good reason provided.    Singapore to Auckland. The cabin crew was amazing, attentive, friendly and professional. My special thanks to the Captain and the Head of Crew. I recommend this airline for passengers who visit NZ.   My wife and I were travelling to Poland via Singapore and Frankfurt. We had one oversize package, namely a painting rolled and contained in a tube. We were not sure what to do with it as it was very light but more than a meter long. The staff at the Adelaide airport have done their utmost to help us, they contacted the baggage people, took the tube to them and then dispatched it for us! Amazing. Then on board they welcomed us as if we were long lost friends. Hats off to the crew of Flight. SQ 278 on the 19 Sep.   The flight was very pleasant and the staff was exemplary. They were kind courteous and very helpful. The service was excellent. The staff catered to our every need and I will definitely fly Singapore Airlines again. Our flight was on 12th September 2023 and the slight number was SQ 421. A huge thank you to the chief air hostess and to the crew.   We were given a flight with Scoot from Bangkok to Singapore, and then with Singapore to Auckland. The flight with Scoot was perfectly acceptable but what was not was that they decided that we must collect our boarding pass in Singapore which might have been OK but they they never told us where to collect them from, so we we spent ages trying to find the location and only just made it to the gate in time. The previous leg from Milan to Hanoi involved a Scoot flight and we received all our passes in Milan. On the flight when meals were served the crew just appeared at the seat with a tray whilst we were dozing and expected us to put out the table. As we had ordered book the cook, the main meal service took a while and we had finished our meal before drinks were offered. Premium economy food was no better than Economy fare and considering the cost of the flight a little more thought could have gone into the meal.   Kudos to the staff at Singapore Airlines, good job at managing customers, friendly service, highly professional and eager to be of assistance. Helpful, polite and well presented! I had such a wonderful experience and pleasant flight! Food delicious! Thank you once again for contributing to my amazing holiday experience.   I use Singapore Airlines a lot so obviously like the airline, and having Gold Frequent filer status does help when flying economy. fast track check in and lounge access to make things a bit smoother. I fly economy on Singapore Airlines but this was the first time in economy on a SQ long haul flight for about 6 years. Boarding was fine, quickly to my seat 45A, departed a little late but once in the air for around 1 hour service was started. Crew where okay food served quickly and again nothing special just okay. The flight lasting 12 hours passed fairly quick, I found the seats a bit uncomfortable after 4 or 5 hours, the crew where around a little bit and the 2nd meal served 3 hours prior to arrival was okay. Connecting to Bangkok pretty easy and the 2 hour uneventful flight on a new 787 was pretty nice. Returning Check in at Bangkok was quick security and immigration done quickly too, used the Krisflier lounge which was pretty nice, the flight to SIN I was seated in seat 42A, food and drinks where offered but the crew after requesting my choice forgot to deliver the food or a drink, It was a bit odd and the crew on this flight where actually a bit rude anyway. Connection in SIN good again, my flight back to London in Premium Economy, so a chance to compare. Yes of course we are paying for the space, but food and crew are the same as economy. Premium Economy wise I think SQ is okay, I will continue to use, because its normally consistent but there are better and much cheaper Premium Economy options around.   My wife and I had booked a trip to Europe. We unfortunately had to cancel the day before we were scheduled to leave due to a death in the family. I did not have trip insurance and had obtained the tickets with miles. The miles were not refundable. I called Singapore and after providing medical documentation, they generously credited me my miles back so we can re-book our trip at a later date. To me, this is the sign of a FIRST CLASS organization. They were in their rights not to refund the miles, but they did. I have flown Singapore for years, even if a had to take a second flight to arrive at my destination. I will continue to use Singapore every chance I get. I give them 5 stars for their compassion, consideration and rapid response. Thank you.  Check-in and boarding in Penang were smooth. The lounge in Penang was quite ordinary but completely adequate. On board, the window seat was very comfortable, though storage was limited. My pre-ordered vegetarian meal hadnt been loaded, so I was given a very bready pizza from Economy class. At Changi the Singapore Business lounge in Terminal 3 was vastly superior to those of most airlines, even when crowded. The process of boarding the A380 was smooth. The seat was comfortable and converted into a good bed, but a little tight around the feet. My vegetarian meal was delicious. The number of toilets in the Business section was limited, and there were Economy-type queues in the morning. The luggage was available quickly. Overall a very good experience.   At Melbourne airport the check-in was very quick and friendly, and the lounge was pleasant and had a good selection of food and drink. Onboard the cabin crew was welcoming, and the seat on the B777 was very comfortable with adequate storage though the diagonal arrangement for lying flat was awkward. No amenities kit was provided. The quality of the vegetarian meals was way above that of other airlines. The flight arrived in Singapore a little early and transfer to a nearby gate for the second leg to Japan leaving in 70 minutes was easy. The boarding process was efficient, and the crew on the B787 were also welcoming and the seat was comfortable (not diagonal for sleeping), though storage space was more limited. The flight arrived on time and luggage was available quickly. All in all a very pleasant journey.   I cannot speak highly enough of the superlative service received on this flight. After I lost one earbud deep down into my seat the crew were determined to retrieve it for me - the lovely hostess thrust her wrist into the seat workings and fished out my earbud, sustaining some pain and minor abrasion. Unbelievable devotion to service! Every other aspect of the crews service was impeccable as well. I can wholeheartedly recommend Singapore Airlines - I have just flown Economy Class from London to Singapore and the service was fabulous on that flight as well. I am writing this review on in-flight wi-fi - seems to be working fine, for the first time in my experience.  As always great new planes, friendly service, lots of legroom. On time every time, staff extremely helpful, and even in economy food very good. We will always where possible fly Singapore Airlines. Thank you you are a big part of our holidays.  Premium economy in Singapore Airlines is terrible. The seats are hard and uncomfortable, the food is the same as economy and there is no separate toilet in the PE cabin (only the economy toilets). We had to ask for a bottle of water, there was no amenity kit and when we asked for socks, the kit we received contained socks and a toothbrush (no toothpaste). The staff were nice but premium economy is simply a premium price for economy quality. Next time I need to go to Europe, Ill look to transit through the US rather than Singapore.   My partner is a student, and weÆ’??re in the process of moving her home, we called to add her student Kris-Flyer account to her ticket and they confirmed over the phone they did, and that they left a note and that they unfortunately couldnÆ’??t send email confirmation - despite our requests. The ground crew were asking for email confirmation and attempted to charge us 600+ euros for the extra weight (Æ’?Âª60/kg) despite our allowance supposedly covering this. Then the ground crew advised us to pay now and attempt to claim later (which in a previous experience which costed me Æ’?Âª2000 didnÆ’??t get me any return) We turned up 4 hours before our flight. ItÆ’??s been 2 while being on hold again for another hour to get re-confirmation. If you value you your time more than this avoid them if you can, pre-covid, Singapore was best in class. Now theyÆ’??ve begun to nose-dive.   I have always had a good cabin experience with Singapore and been a Gold Member for decades. However a recent baggage issue has left me gobsmacked by their tardiness and callous behaviour. Landed in SIN on a stopover and noticed my Delsey case (only 12kg total check in) had a 6 inch case fracture. I reported it and received a case number. On arriving into Cairns the next day, there was no customer service representative visible so I could not pursue the matter. After calling SQ in Singapore after 3 weeks I was finally emailed by a local representative who saw the bag damage photos and offered 100 dollars full settlement for a new bag worth 400 dollars.  The experience has let me reconsider any future SQ travel plans.   Baggage handling was very poor. My new suitcase was very badly handled. All 4 wheels were broken and pulling handle was jammed. Upon lodging complaint they simply said this is caused by routine handling and airline can do nothing about it. This was very bad and was not expected from an airline among top airlines of the world.   We had a wonderful crew, especially Singapore to Zurich SQ346 17/7/23 with Marissa, Celeste, Joanne and Scarlet who looked after us wonderfully. They attended to all our needs with no fuss. Thankyou.   The service was excellent. Very impressed to see Singapore Airlines continuing to be one of my favourite airlines to travel with. The meals were excellent, inflight entertainment was excellent, and the cleanliness in the washrooms were perfect on both of my flights. It is always wonderful travelling with Singapore Airlines and will always continue to use the airline for future travels! Way to go Singapore Airlines!   Singapore Airlines impressed me with their outstanding customer service. Despite the unfortunate incident of my stolen passport, they rebooked my flight twice at no cost, showing exceptional flexibility and support. Their quick responses, transparent communication, and genuine care for passengers make them a top choice for hassle-free travel. Kudos to Singapore Airlines for turning a potentially disastrous situation into a shining example of world-class service.  My flight arrive late which cause a 50 minute delay. Overall not a bad flight. Food was tasty, seat were comfortable and the best inflight entertainment and they are trying to do their best to make up for the delay. On my return flight a 1hour 10 minute delay m. Also not a bad flight. It was the same as my other flight.   This year we have returned to fly with Singapore Airlines after some years of absence. No regrets! The service, food and everything is way better than other airlines we flew with, including Emirates last year (gluten-free meals on Singapore Airlines are very tasty, unlike Emirates GF meals). Impeccable service that caters for all the needs and even whims of passengers, including my request for a slice of lemon for my tea (the Polish way), which Nadine fullfilled with ease and a smile on the SQ325 flight on 16 July 2023. God bless you, Nadine!   Thank you to the crew of Chis, Fred, Shin Ru, Mabel, Fhri and Gui Fang. A long time since I have traveled with Singapore Airlines and they are amazing. Great service and food. Extremely comfortable seating.   We had this unpleasant experience while flying with Singapore Airline SQ 622 on July 9th, 2023 at 13:55 from SIN to KIX airport. One of the staff at the plane door who supposed to help my wife to cover the baby stroller with a plastic bag refused to do the job with ours and ask my wife to do it by herself. We saw him covered others baby stroller with a plastic bag in front of our eyes but refused to do the same thing with ours. This is unacceptable and very rude.    My first time on a Singapore Airlines flight and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the gluten free meals offered, the variety of inflight entertainment, the excellence of service, the continuous cleanliness of the toilets and just the overall ease of boarding, flying and of course the airport!   When booking my flight I advised the travel agent I am a coeliac so need a gluten free diet, but I also have allergies to dairy and egg, so needed a GF Vegan meal, thinking this would be the easier option. When I boarded the flight was advised I could have either the GF meal or the Vegan. As the GF had dairy in it was not suitable, and the Vegan has gluten in. They advised me to contact the staff at the airline when I arrived to organise the return flights.  I had fruit which the lovely cabin crew sourced from business class and a bag of potato chips.  I contacted our travel agent to be informed I was listed for the GF vegan meals. So contacted Singapore airlines, the person I spoke to said it was not acceptable that I needed a combination of the two they only dealt with one allergy per person! I would need a Drs certificate if I had to have it. He then told me to take my own food. Which I ended up doing, but the amount of room available on the plane is minimal and awkward to get to bags when youÆ’??re elderly. Again the crew managed to source some fruit for me.   I find it appalling that SAÆ’??s flight attendants allow children seated in Economy to come visit their parents in Business. I didnÆ’??t pay in excess of $5000 per ticket to be sharing the aisle with other people and be irritated by the noise produced. I was seated in 17D, the person in question was in A17, his child came at night and they played loud games, I was hearing the childÆ’??s talking and laughing through my sleep. I believe that itÆ’??s not professional behavior on the part of SAÆ’??s FAs and they shouldnÆ’??t be allowed to place parents and minors in different classes, let alone let the visitors in, no matter what age. I will not be flying Singapore Airlines any longer unless this problem gets fixed.   Worst business class seats. Why does SQ still have business class seats where the place to put your feet is not in line with the rest of your body? And the transition from bed to sitting is NOT a button push. Rather: Get out of seat. Flip seat with handles. Get back into seat/bed.   I flew to Singapore from London Heathrow in economy class on the SQ319 Airbus A380. Flight left and arrived on time. The positives: Flight crew were pleasant, friendly and polite. They still have high standards and give you a lovely welcome when you arrive onboard. Seats were fairly comfortable and enough space to stow your belongings and move around the cabin. Was given a sleeping pillow and a blanket. Negatives: Singapore Airlines have cut the quality and diversity of food and drinks that they have on offer. It was not the standard of food previously experienced on SQ flights. Presentation not good - now just mediocre. No juice, water or alcoholic beverages offered when you first get on the plane. No menu. Toilets werenÆ’??t clean and very small. You no longer get an amenity kit with toothbrush, eye shades, ear plugs, or socks or a newspaper. Bring back the hot towel service.   I would like to give special praise for Air Stewardess Nurul who served me at the Premium Economy cabin. She has been very proactive in asking and suggesting drinks and snacks to eat throughout the trip. Very friendly , good listener and very conversant.    The First Suite has a lot of space and a lot of gadgets, and some fellow travelers might be impressed. I was rather disappointed by the outline and design of the suite. The bed is not in the direction of the travel, but across the suite. It is narrow and very hard. If the bed is in the non-sleeping position, then it just hangs at the wall to the next suite like a white chunk of wood. In order to dine from the table one has to turn the chair towards the aisle, or towards the fellow traveller in the opposite suite (which is not very private, when, as in my case, the door does not close properly). On both legs to and from Sydney there were technical issues in the suite: either the door could not be closed properly, or the entertainment system did not work at all, or not properly, the seat belt did not fit into the mattress, etc. To add as well, that Singapore Airlines seems to have cut the quality and diversity of the food and wine on offer. Only the Caviar was nicely presented and met the quality standard of First Class food. (On my way to Singapore I have enjoyed Swiss and their First Class product. For a frequent traveller their product was First Class all over, (only with the exception of the bathroom).    I flew with SQ to and from Auckland on the A 350 - 6 May and 22 May. Both flights were a very nice experience. All flight crew very pleasant and helpful and an especial thanks to Edward - senior flight crew on the outward bound flight from Auckland to Singapore. He epitomised the high standards the SQ expect from their staff. Seats fairly comfortable but slightly awkward layout in the lie flat mode with foot well at an angle. I ordered book the cook and the meals were delicious apart from the Thai Red curry served on the Auckland Singapore leg which was reminiscent of boarding school stew with no flavour. Toilet cleanliness maintained to a high standard. However on both legs the sleeping pillow smelled sour. I am sure the pillow cases were clean but the actual pillows require regular washing as well. Please bring back the hot towel service .   From start to finish, the service, food, and cabin crew provided the very best. There are only 4 first class seats on the 777 and as expected more than enough space to stow belongings and move around the cabin. The cabin crew were attentive without being intrusive. Only two negatives. The toilets are tiny and one almost needs to be a contortionist to get changed into pyjamas and the seats although very wide do not have much padding or recline so are uncomfortable for sitting in for long periods of time. In the lie flat mode a good mattress was provided which made the bed comfortable. Food was exceptional and beautifully presented. Only hope that the hot towel service makes a comeback.   Suites on the A380 are in terms of comfort and layout 100% better than on the SQ 777 although the high standard of service remains the same for both aircraft. Lovely welcome from the staff and the cabin crew are exceptionally well presented in grooming and demeanour.  I also am appreciative that I was addressed by my title and surname as I am of that older generation that appreciates such niceties. The suite very comfortable and lovely to have a seperate bed. The two bathrooms are spacious with many amenities and the food glorious. A very special thank you to senior flight crew Tasha (from Indonesia) who was so friendly and epitomised all that is excellent with SQ and also to Kelvin whom I think was the flight manager.   Very slow and poor customer service from Singapore airlines. I flew from Johannesburg to Bangkok on 20/05/2023. Upon arrival, I noticed my luggage was damaged (the bottom of my bag was broken and the wheel broke off). I contacted Singapore airlines for assistance. they replied with several different emails requesting documentation and pictures which I sent. I am flying back to Johannesburg tomorrow (29/05/2023) without a bag I can use. Ive indicated the urgency to Singapore airlines but theres no regard for this.    Left 2.5 hours late and we almost missed our Singapore Airlines connecting Flight as the Skyrail between terminals was not working and we had 25 mins to get from terminal 1 to Terminal 3. When we arrived at the gate we were told to go to, By Singapore Airlines Sign as we Departed our flight. The gate was shut. We found out by a passerby that the gate changed 2.5 hours previously and was now another 10 mins further on, we made it but our luggage did not. We got on plane to find we were seated separately.  We booked in with staff together & we arrived together. We got to Manchester and were told luggage would be about 4 days. on the 5th day we went to the Airport 2 hours later we emerged hopeful & our baggage arrived on the 6th Day only to find the suitcase with missing roller & damaged. We had to use our own money to buy underware, toiletries, clothes for 2 people & a suitcase. This will be refunded but in the meantime we had to use our own money. I get to the airport to fly out this morning & there is no register of my Vegetarian meal on departing flight and I did enter it at the same time I did the previous flight.  We lost 1/3 of our holiday 100% due to delays. We were allowed to go to the Business Class lounge on the way out as compensation, I should be grateful for Vegetarian Sausages before I leave & a glass of Wine.  Compensation should have been upgrade to business class. We paid extra Premium Economy as we thought it would be more comfortable and relaxing but couldnt have been worse.    Very poor service from flight attendants. There was no menu and couldnÆ’??t understand what the attendants were offering for a meal because of the mask. Food was served few hours into flight. Wine selection was bad. Never saw the flight attendant after the first meal on an 18 hour flight Was woken up 8 hours into flight to ask if I needed lunch Never saw the flight attendant after that. No toiletries provided.   HND-SIN was pretty poor. Cabin staff didnt seem very happy. Virtually had a bread roll thrown at me. Meal (only one on a 7-hour flight!) was not hot enough - cold in places - and tasteless. Bag drop at HND was a disgrace - the online check in queue moved faster than the other one - with only two desks open it took 40 minutes. There seems to be no benefit or reason to checking in online. The Singapore Airlines app is not very good either. SIN-LHR-SIN were better. Good cabin staff and service, and the food was hotter and better. Bag drop at LHR was smooth. Boarding well organized and smooth. The pilot explained a touch and go landing at LHR well and there was no panic, but it did mean we were 20 minutes late - and we were already a little behind schedule. Singapore airport is a pain as every gate as its own security check, which took quite a long time on the outward trip. I prefer airports where no further checks are needed for transit passengers. SIN-HND was better and the meals were quite good, as was the service. Plane was old, though. Booked the tickets eight months in advance, and they were never cheaper, yet they were only reasonable. Wi-Fi is only available if you register your Kris Flyer number before you board, which I couldnt because Id already registered by ANA Mileage number. Why have this restriction?   
We used this airline recently for our trip to India and will not recommend this airline . Both ground service and cabin crew service not very friendly neither very welcoming. For a 16 hour straight flight you get two full meals and the snacks are just some nuts. No sandwiches are offered unless you ask for it. Meal services are also different, kids are not served first always.(sometimes yes they do). Meals also has no varieties like others  like no fruits or yogurt. We were very excited when we got the tickets as it was our first time using this airline but will not use in the future.   What has happened to SQ. I believe since COVID they have embarked on a wide ranging cost cutting exercise focusing on charging as much as they can for flights while skimping on what they offer customers. It starts with the lounge which resembles a crowded bus station where you need to search for a seat. Bring back the old lounges! On the flights there are no hot towels. No newspapers. No nuts before dinner. No amenity kits. No mattresses.  Food is mediocre. The only thing that hasnÆ’??t changed is the first class cabin crew. I have been a flyer with SQ for over 25 years and have never known it so bad.  SQ937 DPS-SIN on 05/09/23 as first leg of return trip from SE Asia with Hubby. The flight used a 78X and it was full of vacationers mostly families, and many of them may have not traveled by air before so it takes time to line everybody up for boarding. Boarding was done by zones and it was a good thing that boarding time was an hour before departure time, because ground staff had to weed out people lining up not in their boarding zone. The flight attendants were as usual with SQ, very nice courteous and polite, and very helpful even with the most clueless passengers. Soon we were all seated and left just 15 minutes behind. Service started as soon as the plane level off, and the FAs were very efficient yet friendly and communicative. One of them even gave us our second round of Singapore Sling without us asking, and we really appreciate him! For a short 2 hours flight the FAs were able to do two beverage service and a meal in between, and that must be quite a challenge for them! The meal offered are using their new sustainability concept, with paper containers and bamboo cutlery so they can be recycled. We found this an excellent proof that SQ is serious in their effort to go green and reducing use of non-biodegradable materials like plastics. The paper container is quite sturdy and even retains good heat for my Nasi Lemak. The portion was a bit smaller but the taste is just the same compared to past ones I had on SQ. The FAs on this SQ flight wears the mask at all times, as part of their companys safety awareness effort. The cockpit crew gave information about the flight plans before we leave and current Singapore condition just before we start our descent, and we arrived just 10 minutes behind schedule. Overall this is another great flight with SQ.  Despite some allegations of cost-cutting measures surfacing across the internet and social media, Singapore Airlines is still unequivocally and undeniably the best in its class. In an era of self-check in kiosks and self-serve apps, the human touch it provides to all its passengers is remarkably special and the warmth and comfort of the human element is something that is irreplaceable by technology. The cabin crew truly went above and beyond to ensure that the passengers were well looked after. In addition to that, every other aspect of the flight from the checking-in process, lounge, boarding arrangements, punctuality, cabin announcements, seat comfort and functionality, meal service, inflight WiFi and timing and baggage delivery was also seamless and flawless. Flying in Singapore Airlines on a premium cabin is truly and quite literally a heavenly experience at 40,000ft in the sky."
